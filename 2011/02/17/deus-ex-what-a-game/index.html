<p>Some time ago I'd become obsessed with one game. It kept me up late,
fed my imagination, sucked all my free time - so basically did what good
game should. It was not a new production, quite the contrary -it's
release date was year 2000. And the game itself was Deus Ex.</p>

<EXCERPT>

<p>The year is 2050 and you wake up as a rookie named JC Denton - you are
an UNATCO (United Nations Anti Terrorism CoOperation) special agent. In
the beginning your orders are clear and you're there to fight the
terrorists. The first mission takes place in the depths of The Statue of
Liberty, and it gets better further into the game. The plot wanders,
there seem to be many foreign forces entangled, and it may become clear
to you, that actually you're being used as a tool - a blunt one.
Gradually the plot unfolds and you become aware of the whole conspiracy
theory thing. You interact with Majestic 12 and Illuminati secret
organizations and become part of a global terrorist warfare.</p>

<p>As for a game released so many years ago, even before 11 September
2001 - and the terrorist's attacks on WTC - the game is astonishingly
predictive. It envisions cyberwarfare, the rise of China's economic
importance, threads of terrorism and the whole range of technological
topics. Well, mainly some sci-fi visions that became reality the
following years since game's release ;-)</p>

<p>Deus Ex has extremely well thought world. Everything is well laid
out and there are no major glitches. It also offers multiple solutions
to almost each puzzle - you can fight your way through, but you can try
to bribe, steal, sneak and stunt. And the engine supports these actions
perfectly (I've tried sneaking when playing <a
href="http://fallout.bethsoft.com/eng/home/home.php">Fallout: New
Vegas</a> but failed miserably). The myriad of solutions are for you to
choose from. It would be even better if you could influence the plot in
even greater, more substantial degree - but perhaps it would be too much
to ask for.</p>

<p>Of course the game has also some weak sides. Because it's a little
bit dated the graphics are not up to today's standards. The other thing
is that the world seems not too densely populated - but as a matter of
fact it may be because of 2000's hardware limitations.</p>

<p>I got the game from Deus Ex Trilogy Pack (3 games in it, just for
20 PLN). The pack contains also other parts called: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Invisible_War">Deus Ex: Invisible
War</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Snowblind">Project
Snowblind</a>. Invisible War is still an RPG, but Project Snowblind is
just a regular FPS - really daunting. I've played the original Deus Ex
on Linux with Wine - it worked very well and I haven't experience any
problems. I've tried the same approach with Invisible War, but it seems
sooooo buugy that I turned it off after just an hour. Perhaps will try
to run it under Windows some other time - first to see if the bugs are
gone :)</p>

<p>Oh, and there is also a third part coming, which will be a prequel to
the first game. It will be called <a href="http://www.deusex.com/">Deus Ex: Human
Revolution</a>. Go see some trailers and gameplays on You-tube. It seems
well worth the time and money it will cost.</p>

<p>In my opinion first Deus Ex is much better than the next part. I can't wait for Deus Ex: Human Revolution and I hope that it won't disappoint us, Deus Ex lovers :D<br />
<br />
Do you know that every time somebody mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it? ;]</p></div>
