This weekend I've been fiddling with <a href="http://www.qemu.org">QEMU</a>. I've installed <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> on a single image and wanted to have two instances of it communicating via network. Installing the system was easy, but the networking setup was quite a pain. See how I did that...
<EXCERPT>

<p>To make QEMU instances communicate with each other I needed to plug them to a "network". That's why I've created a bridge to which Virtual Instances would connect to. I've used the following script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zygm0nt/889357.js?file=script.sh"></script>


<p>Then I just needed to start Qemu with this command line:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zygm0nt/889359.js?file=cmd%20line"></script>
 

<p>Since I've set up bridge for Qemu instances, I've plugged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TAP</a> interfaces into it. That's why I've needed to specify this in my qemu exec line. I've also added macaddress setting since both my instances were getting the same one.</p>

<p>And that's all! It works like a charm. Now on to some harder things!</p></div>
