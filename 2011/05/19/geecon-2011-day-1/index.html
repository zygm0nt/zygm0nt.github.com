<p>Last week's Java conference - <a href="http://2011.geecon.org">Geecon</a> was very
interesting. It was well prepared, and gave an insight into the current
Java related trends - concurrency, DSLs, polyglot programming. But not
only that - there were also some pretty different talks from excellent
speakers.</p>

<p>
The whole event took 4 days:
</p>

<ul>
<li>University day (wednesday)</li>
<li>2 regular conference days (Thursday + Friday) </li>
<li>hacker garden (Sunday)</li>
</ul>

<p>
I decided to attend only on Thursday and Friday - no time for more. Here
is what interesting happened during those days.
</p>

<EXCERPT>

<h1>Day 1</h2>

<p>The morning got me unprepared. After hard enough, after work travel to
Krakow on Wednesday, I wasn't in the best shape. However after arriving
at the venue, being greeted with breakfast and refreshments I
looked at the rest of the day with real hope.</p>

<p>Since the schedule was tight - three parallel tracks of lecture, I
had to choose, so bare in mind, that is my account of what I've seen and
heard. Others may, of course, differ.</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/dannycoward/">Danny Coward</a> "Java SE: The Road Ahead"</h2>

<p>Danny, being on <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> (considering being also former
Sun's employee a plus) payroll, gave an insightful talk on new things to
came in <a
href="http://blogs.oracle.com/dannycoward/entry/channeling_java_se_7">Java 7</a>. He drew rather serious plans for Java 8.
According to Danny, the main trends in today's Java ecosystem are:</p>

<ul>
<li>parallel programming</li>
<li>language dynamics</li>
</ul>

<p>and he probably is right :) The great things to come with new
versions of Java are:</p>

<ul>
<li>closures in Java (finally!)</li>
<li>extending interfaces</li>
<li>map, filter - functions for collections</li>
<li>lambda expressions - thou in Java 8</li>
</ul>
<p>The talk itself was a nice keynote, but I doubt the road map for Java
will be met in its full extent - the goals aren't that small.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://www.springsource.com/people/jhoeller">Juergen Hoeller</a> "Enterprise Java in 2011"</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.springsource.com/">Spring Source</a> as one of the sponsors sent Juergen to
evangelize about the world of enterprise and Java's place in it :) He
emphasized different kinds of deployment: WAR, cloud deployment - and
the latter's rise of importance.</p>

<p>He pointed out how outdated current application servers are - the
usually lag ~3 years behind the main trends and developers' needs - good
point! He proposed looking under the hood of now-popular cloud
environments: <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App
Engine</a> or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon
Elastic Cloud</a> to look for schemas in them, etc - I intend to listen
to his advice.</p>

<p>All in all this guy gave a great talk covering wide spectrum of
technologies and not focusing on technical stuff too much.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.javaspecialists.eu/contact.jsp">Heinz Kabutz</a> "Reflection madness"</h2>

<p>Despite living on a Greek island, this guy showed also how to whack
ones mind with <a
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/">Java Reflection API</a>. Pure magic! Some
highlights of his talk were:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to get <i>42 + 1 = 44</i></li>
<li>get the size of an object</li>
<li>get method caller's id</li>
<li>add enum values dynamically</li>
</ul>

<p>With all this examples he pointed that using <i>SecurityManager</i>
will prevent such nasty coding practices.</p>

<p>Since he is an editor of <a
href="http://www.javaspecialists.eu/">Javaspecialists.eu</a>
newsletter, all the answers to problems presented in his talk (and many
many more) can be found there. </p>
<p>Well done, not to useful for me, nevertheless - interesting.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mfiguiere">Michael Figuiere</a>,
Cyrille Le Clere
"NoSQL & Datagrid from developer perspective"</h2>
<p>I don't know what to think of this talk. It consisted an introduction
to NoSQL databases but also a bit of problem's description that can be
encountered when dealing with them. Notable thoughts were on:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a sharding ready data structure</li>
<li>denormalization as a useful process for NoSQL DBs</li>
<li>NoSQL usually means <b>no transactions</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>5. <A href="http://hamletdarcy.blogspot.com/">Hamlet D'Arcy</a> "New Ideas for old code"</h2>

<p>Since a lot of developers (all?) have to deal with legacy code - one
way or another, this talk was <i>a must</i>!</p>. The speaker shared
some ideas on how to work with such code and remain sane. The talk was
vivid, interesting and entertaining, well, and the notable thought? Here
they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>51% rule - if you're not committing 51% of your time/your tasks into
fixing your situation than the whole battle <b>is already lost</b>,</li>
<li>read some good stuff!:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672">Martin Fowler's "Refactoring"</a></li>
        <li><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1305828015&sr=1-1">George C. Martin "Clean Code"</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://chadfowler.com/2006/12/27/the-big-rewrite">Chad Fowler "Big Rewrites"</a> - and why they
failed, what's wrong with them</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>use static analysis - <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">Find Bugz</a>, 
pmc</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-query_separation">query-command</a> - a method should be a query or a
command:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>query - returns sth</li>
        <li>command - change the state of an object</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>he also proposed <b>scratch refactoring</b><br/>
    <ol>
        <li>set a timer</li>
        <li>tag your code</li>
        <li><b>refactor without tests</b></li>
        <li>step back and analyze</li>
        <li>is it better? if not, revert</li>
    </ol>
</li></ul>

<p>This was nice! - it assumed arriving at a project with no ( or
little) tests.</p>

<h2>6. Aslan Knutsen "Arquillian"</a></h2>

<p>The last talk of that day was about some new library from JBoss that
would allow to test your components with unit tests - test them in a
destination container. The whole point of this library is to run the
specific fragment of code as if it was build and deployed to some
application server (let's say JBoss AS ;-) ). To be honest, I can't find
much application for that - thou I'm not doing any serious work in JEE
world.</p>

<h2>Party</h2>

<p>And the day ended. But there was sth else to do after the official
part - party time! It took place at <a href="">Klub Pauza</a> on
Floriańska street. It was a rather nice social event.</p>
