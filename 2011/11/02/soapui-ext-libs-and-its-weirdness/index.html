<p>Suppose you want to add some additional jars to your SoapUI installation. It all should work ok if you put them in <b>bin/ext</b> directory. It is scanned at startup, and jars found there are automatically added to classpath.
</p>

<p>
However if you want to add some JDBC drivers, and happen to be using SoapUI version higher than 3.5.1 it is a bit more tricky.
</p>
<p>You may face this NoClassDefFoundError:<br/>

<pre>
An error occured [oracle/jdbc/Driver], see error log for details
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: oracle/jdbc/Driver
</pre>
</p> 

<p>
If so, try regist zygm0ntering your drivers with <b>registerJdbcDriver</b> function, like I did in this snippet of code:
