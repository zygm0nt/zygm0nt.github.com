      <p>HBase is by design a columnar store, that is optimized for random reads.
You just ask for a row using rowId as an identifier and you get your
data instantaneously.</p>
<p>Performing a scan on part or whole table is a completely different thing.
First of all, it is sequential. Meaning it is rather slow, because it
doesn&rsquo;t use all the RegionServers at the same time. It is implemented
that way to realize the contract of Scan command - which has to return
results sorted by key.</p>
<p>So, how to do this efficiently?</p>
<p>The usual way of getting data from HBase is with the help of its API,
mainly Scan objects. To accomplish the task I&rsquo;ll use just them. I&rsquo;ll
specify startRow and stopRow, so that each Scan request will be looking
through only part of the key space.</p>
<p>It is crucial to note, that this whole solution works because of key
sorting properties in HBase. So, HBase scans a table according to ascending key
values. Since keys are of String type, key with value &ldquo;1&rdquo; is smaller
than &ldquo;2&rdquo;, because they are sorted lexicographicly. So, also key with value &ldquo;12345&rdquo; is smaller than &ldquo;2&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve
leveraged this property so that I&rsquo;ve partitioned my whole key space according to
the first character of the key. In my case keys contain only digits. So I
have 10 ranges:</p>
<ul>
<li>null-1</li>
<li>1-2</li>
<li>2-3</li>
<li>3-4</li>
<li>4-5</li>
<li>5-6</li>
<li>6-7</li>
<li>7-8</li>
<li>8-9</li>
<li>9-null</li>
</ul>
<p>The speedup comes from the fact, that each range resides in its own
partition. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;ve presplit the table to have 10 partitions.
This corresponds rather nicely with my cluster&rsquo;s setup, because I have
more than 10 RegionServers. So every partition should be on different
RegionServer. It will allow the code to do the requested scan operations
in parallel - giving me this exact performance boost.</p>
<p>How I&rsquo;ve created the input table:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>$ create &rsquo;tariff_changes&rsquo;, { NAME =&gt; &lsquo;cf&rsquo;, SPLITS_FILE =&gt; &lsquo;splits.txt&rsquo;, VERSIONS =&gt; 50, MAX_FILESIZE =&gt; 1073741824 }</p>
<p>$ alter &rsquo;tariff_changes&rsquo;, { NAME =&gt; &lsquo;cf&rsquo;, SPLITS_FILE =&gt; &lsquo;splits.txt&rsquo;, VERSIONS =&gt; 50, MAX_FILESIZE =&gt; 1073741824 }</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Split file is just something along this lines:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This tells HBase what are the rowKeys starting and ending each of the
partitions.</p>
<p>Ok, so after this rather lengthy introduction, what the actual code
does? It just spins of a few threads - one for each partition - and runs
a Scan request tailored to that partitions key space. This way, I got a
10x speedup for this particular scan. The execution time went down from
30 minutes to 3 for my use case.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created an example implementation of this idea. You can find it on
GitHub:

<p>Any ideas on how to speed things up even more with HBase?</p></div>
