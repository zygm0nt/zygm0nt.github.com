<p>Who would have thought? Me switching to Mac? But it actually happened. I&rsquo;ve been a long time Linux user, so why actually do the switch now? Or ever? Have a look at my thoughts and insights of novice Mac user.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h2>
<p>My humble beginnings were with RedHat 6.0 on a AMD Duron 600Mhz PC machine. With a dialup connection. And setting that thing to connect into Poland&rsquo;s national provider TPSA was rather painful. After some time using Linux, going from RedHat to Slackware I&rsquo;ve decided things weren&rsquo;t tough enough and switched to BSDs. That was really fun! I&rsquo;ve used Free and Open flavors for a few years which very really great. Than switched back to Linux. I&rsquo;ve used those *nix systems for all-things-computer. At home and at work.</p>
<h2 id="the-switch">The switch</h2>
<p>And than came the new job and I had to choose: regular Dell or Macbook? Blue pill or red pill? I chose the later.</p>
<p>The switch wasn&rsquo;t that painful, but mainly thanks to superb hardware Apple offers. Having to get used to a completely new OS was quite another story. It&rsquo;s not that I was shocked by it. As a long time Linux user all the concepts are known to me. It&rsquo;s the other way around - there are a lot of things missing that I learned to require from my tool of work.</p>
<p>What I really appreciate is the known userland tools - it&rsquo;s BSD at the heart of it. Well, of course the kernel is some whacky Mach microkernel, but as for the userland I&rsquo;m happy :) You can read more about the kernel and system&rsquo;s design history on wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">Os X</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU</a>)</p>
<p>One of the biggest disappointments was the filesystem and the way it&rsquo;s presented to users. Mac OS X comes with HFS+ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">link</a>) filesystem which is case insensitive!!! To me this seems like an abomination. Plus there are multiple shortcuts taken by Apple engineers, like its endiannes: primarily Macs used PowerPC chips which are BigEndian by desing, but after switching to Intel processors everything is LittleEndian now. AFAIK HFS+ has to still switch bytes when reading metadata.</p>
<p>Really neat thing I&rsquo;ve found out recently is that under the hood OS X uses PF (OpenBSD&rsquo;s packet filter) as a firewalling solution.
I don&rsquo;t know which version is in the current release and how does it compare against the original implementation, but since PF has such a nice syntax and performance it&rsquo;s great to have it on board. There are numerous blog posts about setting a decent firewall on OS X with PF so go have a look. Also you can play with PF by means of a set of apps called <a href="http://www.murusfirewall.com/">Murus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="useful-tools">Useful tools</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://brew.sh/">Brew</a> - basic application provider, offers all the things I&rsquo;ve become used to when on Linux,</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst">Amethyst</a> - allows window tiling with keyboard shortcuts and has focus-follows-mouse :D I love this feature, although with all the windows popping all over the place I must admit it sometimes gets messy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/">MenuMeters</a> - have a bunch of those geeky meters all over the place (no longer usable with El Capitan)</li>
<li>Alfred - seems like a nice app, Spotlight on steroids. It&rsquo;s free and you can download it via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/alfred/id405843582?mt=12">ITunes</a></li>
<li>Flashlight - add more providers to Spotlight - unfortunately with recent introduction of rootless mac partition it&rsquo;s no longer possible to use this tool</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hacking-spotlight">Hacking Spotlight</h2>
<p>Spotlight is just that neat little thing out there that seems like indexing all the things and runs installed programs. But it can also serve as a calculator and &hellip;</p>
<p>You can also read the contents of its cache file.</p>
<p>Up until version 10.10.4 of OS X it was possible to have additions to spotlight, but now this behaviour is blocked by the system.

<h2 id="script-setup">Script setup</h2>
<p>Setup your mac with this shell script - but be very careful and read through this file first! <a href="https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465">https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465</a></p>

<h2 id="neat-things">Neat things</h2>
<p>And it is quite positive, that Mac OS X developers care about small, but extremely important things - like building OpenSSH with LibreSSL support!</p>
<h2 id="dtrace">DTrace</h2>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve experienced a huge slowdown on my Mac. The It support&rsquo;s solution was to reinstall the OS. I refused, this seemed like a barbaric method and also I just wanted to use this opportunity to delve deeper into internals of this OS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started with analysing system behaviour with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a> - probing interface originating from Solaris</p>
<p>Useful introductory links are here:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all the switch was relatively painless, and with tools and tricks described here I feel very comfortable using this system.</p></div>
