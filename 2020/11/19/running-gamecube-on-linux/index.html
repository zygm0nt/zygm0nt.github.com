      <p>I have a fondness for all the retro things in tech, and try to hone this when I have time with exploring old tech. This time I tried running one of the retro consoles' emulators. I chose Nintendo Gamecube - because of many reasons, but one of them being I own a quite recent incarnation of the Nintendo spirit, namely Nintendo Switch. So with the older one I&rsquo;ve wanted to see how the games look like back than and how much the landscape of gaming on Nintendo has changed with that big of an age gap.</p>
<p>The only Gamecube emulator I know of is called <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a>.</p>
<p>Since my current retro gaming machine is linux-based and there is no prebuilt version for my os version I&rsquo;ve just compiled it from sources. Pretty astonished that for such a big project, with lots of changes there are only 5 major tags in the repo. And so since I didn&rsquo;t want to have a lagging version by building from 5.0 stable tag I&rsquo;ve decided to go full-on on build from the top of master branch.</p>
<p>Following the build instructions, the whole process went rather smoothly. Starting games is easy and as long as they&rsquo;re well supported by the emulator there really aren&rsquo;t any issues with them.</p>
<p>My main problem however is with the controls. The original controller for Gamecube is quite an elaborate one. Emulating that behavior with the keyboard seems too cumbersome, too inconvenient. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve tried using Xbox 360 controller I had lying around. Which proved to be somewhat of a success but not a complete one. There is an implemented way to do it in Dolphin, there&rsquo;s even a very nice tool to assign keys. But unfortunately stick calibration does not work, at least for me, at least not now.</p>
<p>After asking on the DolphinEmu forums about this &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; it actually came out as my error. I should have chosen the &ldquo;keys&rdquo; for the sticks first. This not being that obvious in the first place now seems like something obvious considering other steps of the calibration process :D</p>
