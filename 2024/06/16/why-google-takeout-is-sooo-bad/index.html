<em>Author: <a href="https://ideogram.ai">IdeogramAI</a> Prompt: The image shows a typical Google Takeout interface with a large error message indicating that the service is unavailable. In the background, there are frustrated users trying to download their data with unsuccessful attempts, represented by repeated &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retry&rdquo; notifications.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My current data setup is centered around Google Cloud as a place where I store my data. That&rsquo;s also related to how I use the whole vendor ecosystem.</p>
<p>The main issue I have with keeping the data only in Google Cloud is data safety. I just don&rsquo;t want either identity theft or accidental block on my account (by Google) to cut me off from all of my previous photos. You might think it&rsquo;s something close to impossible, but there are numerous examples of that happening to people - eg. look here <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html</a> And ok, this might be a reasonable approach from Google, but who knows what else can trigger that kind of blockage.</p>
<p>So, to be safe against anything similar or just any other data lose, it would be good to have some backup in place.</p>
<p>An ideal solution right now would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy all the photos to some other cloud</li>
<li>have an offline copy of those files/photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally both of those should happen automatically, according to some predefined schedule. Of course be as maintenance-free as possible.</p>
<p>I have ~200GB of data that I would like backed up on a regular basis. I&rsquo;d imagine this is not the biggest set of photos a person can have stored there.</p>
<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>My first approach was to synchronize all the files and all the photos using some syncing tools. Store them on a local hard drive, for future use. But that was less then satisfying. Mainly due to how long the process would take for my size of data.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this open-source python tool <a href="https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync">https://github.com/gilesknap/gphotos-sync</a> - but I&rsquo;m yet to try that. Although they also note on their project page issues with the backup process. Citing from there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos are transcoded to lower quality</li>
<li>Raw or Original photos are converted to &lsquo;High Quality&rsquo;</li>
<li>GPS info is removed from photos metadata</li>
</ul>
<p>Bad, but I could live with that, if treating this as a backup.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a paid tool <a href="https://photovaultone.com/">https://photovaultone.com/</a> - but it&rsquo;s just another small vendor lock-in. I&rsquo;d like to avoid getting deeper into other vendor to be protected from Google.</p>
<h2 id="so-theres-google-takeout">So there&rsquo;s Google Takeout</h2>
<p>And yet, there&rsquo;s this Google-offered option, that&rsquo;s designed as a way to take all your data out of Google Cloud and potentially go to some other vendor, or host that on your own. Great idea! <del>Of course Google, as other BigTech companies was coherced to implement it mainly due to GDPR restrictions - so that any user can take the data he/she owns and move out to other place.</del> Actually, Google Takeout was created before GDPR restrictions - this comment brings some info on that:
Naturally, I thought I&rsquo;d use this approach to backup my data.
This seemed even more amazing, as there&rsquo;s an option to backup directly to other providers - the options are Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Box.</p>
<p>I thought that using Microsoft OneDrive is a good alternative! Especially in terms of provider diversification. Also, the options of the backup would allow me to create a couple of bigger files - and copying those to my local backup would be much easier then doing so with hundreds of thousands of photos.</p>
<p>Choosing Microsoft OneDrive as an intermediate solution is just using another vendor. But the goal is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have the data backed up in another cloud</li>
<li>be able to download the data in bigger chunks</li>
</ul>
<p>On the surface, it looks nice. You can create a scheduled backup process - that may happen at specified intervals, or you can do it one-time.
You can select data you want to export - be it just Photos, or maybe whole Google Drive, and Calendar, Gmail. Everything is there.</p>
<p>But when it actually needs to happen - that&rsquo;s where the issues happen.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>the process always fails - no matter what&rsquo;s the size of a chunk I choose</li>
<li>the logs are kept only for some time, afer 7 days I&rsquo;m not able to see what happened with the chunks. It&rsquo;s easy to spot missing files - when you have parts from 1 to 10, but there&rsquo;s a 7th missing. But what if there are 10 parts but should be 11?</li>
<li>no logs of the process</li>
<li>errors are very cryptic &ldquo;Failed to backup&rdquo;</li>
<li>tech support is non-existent - I&rsquo;ve reached out to the tech support, but they were just passing my issue between different support divisions. Ultimately there were hints like &ldquo;reinstall your operating system&rdquo;, &ldquo;turn it off and on&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all I don&rsquo;t see this whole process as <strong>extremely</strong> hard. Also, I totally understand those things may fail. But we, as an industry, know what to do with that. There are retries, informative logging. And here I got none of the above.</p>
<p>So for me, this broadly looks like Google just does not want people to backup their data outside of their cloud, which is super bad!</p>
<h2 id="important-considerations-that-i-may-have-missed">Important considerations that I may have missed</h2>
<p>I share my photo collection with my closest family. I suspect that Google Takeout won&rsquo;t backup those shared photos. But my purpose <strong>is</strong> to do also copy those.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ll be able to make this process reliable, I&rsquo;d need to think of data retention on target.</p>
<p>Right now I backup just Google Photos - wanted to move to other parts of the ecosystem, when the backup issues are sorted out.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-actions">Follow-up actions</h2>
<ul>
<li>try other providers - I don&rsquo;t want to use Dropbox, but perhaps Box would work better then OneDrive?</li>
<li>are there tools that I&rsquo;ve missed that might actually work?</li>
<li>schedule separate backup processes for other parts of the data stored in Google - they&rsquo;ll be smaller and maybe that will result in successful backups</li>
<li>monitor the backup process state - based on target drive contents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h2>
<p>So, for know I still do the backups. I accept the issues with Google Takeout. It&rsquo;s just better to have majority of my data, then to not have any of that.</p>

<p><em>Edited:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>2024-06-17 - correct reference to GDPR and Google Takeout</em>
<ul>
<li>comment from <code>BXlnt2EachOther</code>: <em>I don&rsquo;t think this can be correct. Takeout was released June 28, 2011. GDPR was passed April 14, 2016 and went into effect two years later.</em></li>
<li>comment from <code>jchw</code>: <em>Well, that&rsquo;s just simply false. Google Takeout was in development and released much earlier than GDPR was published. It was an internal project of a weird Google team known publicly as the &ldquo;Google Data Liberation Front&rdquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t actually at Google during any of this, but I recall Google Takeout from ages ago, and it&rsquo;s hard to forget, in part because it seemed so novel for the time, and also the name &ldquo;Data Liberation Front&rdquo; stuck out as being surprisingly bold.</em></li>
