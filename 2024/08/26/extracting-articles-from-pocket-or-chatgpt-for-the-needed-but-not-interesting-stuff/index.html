<p><a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> is a nice service. It can save articles from the web for you to read later. Nice. It can even help in bypassing annoying paywalls (more on this <a href="/2024/02/29/payload-after-load/">here</a>). With the ease of using it, I can quickly end up with a substantial backlog of articles to go through. Since reading long articles on a screen feels like a chore, I came up with the idea of exporting articles into EPub format and reading them on an e-reader.</p>
<p>My first approach to solving this was with Zapier. I hadn&rsquo;t used it before but had read that it was possible to create an integration that would connect to Pocket, check for articles marked with a specific tag, and then export the contents of the article into a PDF using some external service. This required multiple sites to cooperate, new accounts, and API keys, etc. It all seemed fragile, and in the end, it didn’t work.</p>
<p>But maybe there are others ways to do that?</p>
<h3 id="first-try">First try</h3>
<p>The first attempt was to use the Pocket API to fetch the articles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>generate a python script that fetches saved articles from Pocket</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do I get the access token? I need to login and authorize!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>generate python code that performs login into pocket via api</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was quick!</p>
<p>On the plus side</p>
<ul>
<li>no need to go through an API that brings little new things to me.</li>
<li>the code worked almost immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, even with the tokens, the first script did not work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Traceback (most recent call last):

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After examining the output from API, there was no <code>article</code> field - obviously. Maybe it existed at some point, but according to online documentation, Pocket no longer offers document retrieval. Fair enough; it’s their core business.</p>
<h3 id="lets-try-something-else">Let&rsquo;s try Something Else</h3>
<p>For a brief period of time I just wanted to handle the transformation process on my own, using some additional library like <code>readability</code>, or <code>Goose</code>. The flow would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>fetch article metadata from API</li>
<li>get URL of the article from the metadata</li>
<li>transform</li>
</ol>
<p>But this has a serious flaw. In my Pocket Saves, I have a bunch of articles that are either not available anymore or are behind a paywall, etc. And these are the ones I&rsquo;d still want to read. So this approach was no good.</p>
<p>This was a separate ChatGPT session - just an exploration.</p>
<h3 id="pivot">Pivot!</h3>
<p>So maybe I can just use some Javascript code for that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>write a javascript function that looks for element &lt;div lang=&ldquo;en&rdquo;&gt; and copies everything in it (whole html structure) to clipboard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The element mentioned in the message is exactly what keeps article contents - explored in the browser.</p>
<p>I tested that in Firefox console. Well, something worked. But my clipboard was empty, apparently because Firefox was blocking clipboard operations from some random code. Well done in terms of security!</p>
<p>But probably Firefox extensions should be able to alleviate this limitation!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wrap that in a firefox extension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Bam! I got all the necessary code snippets to create a Firefox extension, along with the instructions on how to load that into the browser.</p>
<p>With that approach it just worked. I had the copy of the article in my clipboard.</p>
<p>Well, fine—but going through many articles, copying them into the clipboard, and then saving them to an external file by hand would still be tedious!</p>
<p>It would be much nicer to have the extension preparing the files for me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify the extraction function so as it takes article title from first &lt;h1&gt; element in first &lt;header&gt; element. Use that title to name a file to which the contents of the copied &lt;div&gt; will be stored. The file should be offered as a download.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it did just that! Worked beautifully!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If it was not for the LLM-based conversation I would not accomplish in such a short amount of time. The whole thing took me ~15 minutes. I&rsquo;d also need to learn a bit to accomplish that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m pretty weak at Javascript</li>
<li>I know nothing about building Firefox extensions</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d probably have give up after exploring the first dead-end with Python app accessing API</li>
</ul>
<p>I must say, that this coding session with ChatGPT worked out really well!</p>
<h2 id="afterthoughts---llms-are-good-for-side-quests">Afterthoughts - LLMs are good for side-quests</h2>
<p>There are often situations where I&rsquo;m using a specific application, usually through a browser or some online service with API access. It probably works okay, but there are some aspects that can be improved.</p>
<p>Then comes an idea, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Damn, I use Strava - but I&rsquo;m not 100% OK with them having all my data, what if they end up like Endomondo or other similar services and close their doors at one point?&rdquo; -&gt; I want to backup or have my own copy of the data</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have this backup for all the open tabs I have right now. How to do that? It would be cool to write this single browser extension just for that.&rdquo; -&gt; I&rsquo;d use that again, for backing up, or tracking the number of opened tabs. So, for fun and as a way to keep my hunter-gatherer mind satisfied.</li>
<li>I have this need and habit of reading code - eg. take big pile of code, from an open source project and read it. In the process, I tend to make notes. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to add some annotations to the code. But haven&rsquo;t found a plugin for that. So I&rsquo;ve resorted to ChatGPT for that. And it delivered! It generated Visual Studio Code plugin exactly for this use-case</li>
</ul>
<p>Or any other quite wacky idea, that&rsquo;s not that hard to implement but would require learning a new set of libraries or tools that I&rsquo;m not that fond of learning on my own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the perfect niche that I may use ChatGPT! These tools are pretty small and end easy to describe, even if I need to refine my prompts a few times.</p>
<p>In the examples above, the common pattern emerges. LLMs are a good tool to take an idea that is just a nicety and make it happen. They’re even more useful if I’m not too proficient in some environment—e.g., I don’t know how to write VS Code plugins, and I don’t want to dive deep into that. But I miss this one particular functionality.</p>
