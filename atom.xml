<p>This small conference had its third installment in (http://www.polin.pl/en)[Polin - Museum of the History of Polish Jews]. Organizing Scala conference isn&#8217;t that obvious and having that kind of attention is really great - all the foreign speakers, etc.</p>

<p>Here is a quick recap of presentations I&#8217;ve attended.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Lambda Days 2016 - Kraków</h1>

<p>This last two days I&#8217;ve spend on a conference in Kraków. The topics
revolved around functional programming, with all the experimental stuff,
popular languages, etc. Here are the talks I&#8217;ve been to and short summaries of those:</p>

<h2>Day 1:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Propositions as types</strong> - the keynote delivered by Philip Wadler - seen it already on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">YouTube</a>. But the thing with Lambda t-shirt looked funny again :D</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using &#8220;Program shaping&#8221; and algorithmic skeletons to parallelise an evolutionary multi-agent system in Erlang</strong> - pretty long title, huh :) The presentation, thou very academic was also quite interesting. The whole concept not being particularly new, but the set of tools used for refactorings into parallel code seemed interesting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static analysis to identify divide-and-conquer algorithms</strong> - how to find particular class of algorithms in existing programs? Interesting but shallow, due to time limitations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Mysteries of Dropbox</strong> - John Hughes of QuickCheck fame showed how
to test a big system using blackbox approach. Nice presentation, with
all the great insight he always brings into his talks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Muvr - Jan Machacek</strong> - that was a fun presentation. About how to build an app that detects your exercise routine and counts how many repeats you&#8217;ve done. There&#8217;ve been all:</p>

<ul>
<li>spark pipelining</li>
<li>Swift code demo (it seemed like Swift IDE offers something similar to notebook-like programming, is it?),</li>
<li>live coding
Unfortunately due to WiFi&#8217;s proxy settings the live demo could not be finished, but the code for all this is available somewhere on Github, on <a href="https://github.com/muvr">this account</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Embracing change</strong> - how to introduce Clojure into your company&#8217;s
technology stack seamlessly - by <strong>Artur Skowroński.</strong>
Hilarious presentation about adopting new languages. It wasn&#8217;t that
groundbreaking, at least for me, but the way it was presented, and the
slides with all the Cthulhu references in them, were great!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Day 2:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Things that matter by Bruce Tate</strong> - great energetic talk, with all the ideas about learning
new languages. Bruce is the author of two excellent books: &#8220;Seven
languages in seven weeks&#8221; and &#8220;Seven more languages in seven weeks&#8221; :)
He went through languages mentioned in his books and summed up
principles associated with their inception.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve almost decided to not come to this presentation,
weighting between it and sleeping a little bit longer in my hotel room.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Zen of Akka</strong> - delivered by a resident hakker at Typesafe - Konrad
Malawski. Nice talk about Akka pitfalls, there were lots of
recommendations and even some previously unknown to me features of Akka
toolkit. Plus I loved the Japanese elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creating reactive components using ClojureScript React wrappers</strong> - by
Konrad Szydlo introduced Rum as a wrapper for React, described part of
the ecosystem and explained mechanics behind the technology. Fine
presentation, very intense on content. Konrad had 111 slides, but
managed to show all of them without being hasty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting started with Frege</strong> - Lech Glowiak, Frege seems to be a Haskell
on the JVM, which in itself seems like a nice thing. But I treat such
languages rather as nice experiments, than something useful. Especially
its Java interop looks ugly. Nevertheless the presentation was given
from the point of view of language contributor, which Lech is.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practical demystification of CRDT</strong> - by Dmitry Ivanov and Nami
Naserazad - both of them from TomTom. Guys are working on TomTom&#8217;s
NaviCloud product. Their presentation was a practical guide throught the
world of CRDTs (link to wikipedia). They showed their failures in
implementing the system, gave advices, etc. The whole thing is even
uploaded to github, so everyone can check their code
(http://github.com/ajantis/scala-crdt). I&#8217;ve really enjoyed this talk
due to its technical approach. There were no formal definitions, no
teortical considerations, just clean report from the trenches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purely functiona Web Apps</strong> - by Michał Płachta - how to write Gitlab
companion app in Haskell + Elm? Haskell for backend and Elm for
frontend. This presentation showed great potential of Elm for frontend
development. Moderatly approachable considering Friday afternoon and my
lack of Haskell knowledge. Still, I plan to come back to this
presentation later.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>What I haven&#8217;t seen but plan to as soon as videos are available</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Modeling your domain. What have we learned? Where do we go from here?</strong> - by Norbert Wójtowicz - about modeling domain in Clojurescript apps</li>
<li><strong>The F#orce awakend</strong> - by ewelina Gabasova - F# + geekery, the Twitter
went nuts about that presentation, suppose not without reason</li>
<li><strong>LFE - a lisp flavour on the Erlang VM</strong> - by Robert Virding - don&#8217;t know
why but it seems intriguing enough</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As always, things you didn&#8217;t expect to be interesting were the best
ones. Highlights being presentations by Bruce Tate, Jan Machacek and guys
from TomTom (Dmitry Ivanov and Nami Naserazad)</p>

<p>Thanks to organisers for this conference. But I must say, that day 2 was a lot better than the first one. The talks were better structured and presented.</p>

<p>One idea for the organizers - please print the schedule on the back of
conference badge. It was pretty annoying to have to take out the A4
sheets with whole day schedule each time I wanted to look at it</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>How Super Confitura Man came to be :)</h2>

<p>Recently at TouK we had a one-day hackathon. There was no main theme for
it, you just could post a project idea, gather people around it and hack
on that idea for a whole day - drinks and pizza included.</p>

<p>My main idea was to create something that could be fun to build and be
useful somehow to others. I’d figured out that since Confitura was just
around a corner I could make a game, that would be playable at TouK’s
booth at the conference venue. This idea seemed good enough to attract
Rafał Nowak <a href="https://twitter.com/RNowak3">@RNowak3</a> and Marcin Jasion
<a href="https://twitter.com/marcinjasion">@marcinjasion</a> - two TouK employees, that with me
formed a team for the hackathon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HBase is by design a columnar store, that is optimized for random reads.
You just ask for a row using rowId as an identifier and you get your
data instantaneously.</p>

<p>Performing a scan on part or whole table is a completely different thing.
First of all, it is sequential. Meaning it is rather slow, because it
doesn&#8217;t use all the RegionServers at the same time. It is implemented
that way to realize the contract of Scan command - which has to return
results sorted by key.</p>

<p>So, how to do this efficiently?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with data stored in HBase, you are quick to come to a
conclusion, that it is extremaly inconvenient to reach to it
via HBase native API. It is very verbose and you always need to convert
between bytes and simple types - a pain.</p>

<p>While I was working on a project of mine, I thought, why not to easy
those pains and fetch real objects from HBase.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s how this simplistic, hackish ORM came to life. It is no match
for projects like <a href="https://github.com/impetus-opensource/Kundera">Kundera</a>
(a JPA compliant solution), or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/n-orm/">n-orm</a>. Nevertheless, it just suits my needs :)</p>

    <link href="http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/06/23/zookeeper-curator/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-23T22:20:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/06/23/zookeeper-curator</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="c8"><img height="300" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/assets/2013-06-24-zookeeper-curator.jpg"></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c8">
    <span>An application developed for one of my recent projects at TouK involved multiple servers. There was a requirement to ensure failover for the system&rsquo;s components. Since I had already a few separate components I didn&rsquo;t want to add more of that, and since there already was a Zookeeper ensemble running - required by one of the services, I&rsquo;ve decided to go that way with my solution.</span>
</p><h2 class="c8"><a name="h.v629433u6utf"></a><span>What is Zookeeper?</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Just a crude distributed synchronization framework. However, it implements Paxos-style algorithms (</span><span
        class="c5"><a class="c0" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)</a></span><span>) to ensure no split-brain scenarios would occur. This is quite an important feature, since I don&rsquo;t have to care about that kind of problems while using this app. You just need to create an ensemble of a couple of its instances - to ensure high availability. It is basically a virtual filesystem, with files, directories and stuff. One could ask why another filesystem? Well this one is a rather special one, especially for distributed systems. The reason why creating all the locking algorithms on top of Zookeeper is easy is its Ephemeral Nodes - which are just files that exist as long as connection for them exists. After it disconnects - such file disappears. </span>
</p><p class="c8"><span>With such paradigms in place it&rsquo;s fairly easy to create some high level algorithms for synchronization.</span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Having that in place, it</span><span>&nbsp;can</span><span>&nbsp;safely integrate multiple services ensuring loose coupling in a distributed way.</span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><h2 class="c8"><a name="h.ppqvt63vg53w"></a><span>Zookeeper from developer&rsquo;s POV</span>
</h2><p class="c8"><span>With all the base services for Zookeeper started, it seems there is nothing else, than just connect to it and start implementing necessary algorithms. Unfortunately, the API is quite basic and offers files and directories abstractions with the addition of different node type (file types) - ephemeral and sequence. It is also possible to watch a node for changes.</span>
</p><h2 class="c8"><a name="h.lgfultrxupbf"></a><span>Using bare Zookeeper is hard!</span></h2><p class="c8"><span>Creating connections is tedious - and there is lots of things to take care of. Handling an established connection is hard - when establishing connection to ensemble, it&rsquo;s necessary to negotiate a session also. During the whole process a number of exceptions can occur - these are &ldquo;recoverable&rdquo;
    exceptions, that can be gracefully handled and not break the connection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p
        class="c8"><span>So, Zookeeper API is hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c8"><span>Even if one is proficient with that API, then there come recipes. The reason for using Zookeeper is to be able to implement some more sophisticated algorithms on top of it. Unfortunately those aren&rsquo;t trivial and it is again quite hard to implement them without bugs.</span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c8"><span>And since distributed systems are hard, why would anyone want another difficult to handle tool? </span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><h2 class="c8"><a name="h.8n72xils1l1f"></a><span>Enter Curator</span></h2><p
        class="c8"><span>Happily, guys from Netflix implemented a nice abstraction for dealing with Zookeeper internals. They called it Curator and use it extensively in the company&rsquo;s environment. Curator offers consistent API for Zookeeper&rsquo;s functionality. It even implements a couple of recipes for distributed systems.</span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><h2 class="c8"><a name="h.k63iku7qitza"></a><span>File read/write</span></h2><p
        class="c8"><span>The basic use of Zookeeper is as a distributed configuration repository. For this scenario I only need read/write capabilities, to be able to write and read files from the Zookeeper filesystem. This code snippet writes a sample json to a file on ZK filesystem.</span>

<p class="c8"><span>Having multiple systems there may be a need of using an exclusive lock for some resource, or perhaps some big system requires it&rsquo;s components to synchronize based on locks. This &ldquo;recipe&rdquo;
    is an ideal match for those situations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><a href="#"

        class="c8"><span>This is quite an interesting use case. With many small services on different servers it is not wise to exchange ip addresses and ports between them. When some of those services may go down, while other will try to replace them - the task gets even harder. </span>
</p><p class="c8"><span>That&rsquo;s why, with Zookeeper in place, it can be utilised as a registry of existing services.</span>
</p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c8"><span>If a service starts, it registers into the ServiceRegistry, offering basic information, like it&rsquo;s purpose, role, address, and port. </span>
</p><p class="c8"><span>Services that want to use a specific kind of service request an access to some instance. This way of configuring easily decouples services from their configuration.</span>

    <link href="http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/03/21/zookeeper-tips/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-21T23:56:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/03/21/zookeeper-tips</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a summary of what has been presented by Kathleen Ting on
StrangeLoop conference. You can watch the original here:
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Misconfiguration-ZooKeeper">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Misconfiguration-ZooKeeper</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to put this selection here for quick reference.</p>

<h2>Connection mismanagement</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>too many connections</p>

<pre><code>  WARN [NIOServerCxn.Factory: 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0:2181:NIOServerCnxn$Factory@247] - Too many connections from /xx.x.xx.xxx - max is 60
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>running out of ZK connections?</p>

<ul>
<li>set <code>maxClientCnxns=200</code> in <code>zoo.cfg</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>HBase client leaking connections?</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed in HBASE-3777, HBASE-4773, HBASE-5466</li>
<li>manually close connections</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>connection closes prematurely</p>

<pre><code>  ERROR: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ZooKeeperConnectionException: HBase is able to connect to ZooKeeper but the connection closes immediately.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>in <code>hbase-site.xml</code> set <code>hbase.zookeeper.recoverable.waittime=30000ms</code></p></li>
<li><p>pig hangs connecting to HBase</p>

<pre><code>  WARN org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Session 0x0 for server null, unexpected error, closing socket connection and attempting reconnect java.net.ConnectionException: Connection refused!
</code></pre>

<p>  <strong>CAUSE:</strong> location of ZK quorum is not known to Pig</p>

<ul>
<li>use Pig 10, which includes PIG-2115</li>
<li>if there is an overlap between TaskTrackers and ZK quorum nodes

<ul>
<li>set <code>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</code> to final in <code>hbase-site.xml</code></li>
<li>otherwise add <code>hbaze.zoopeeker.quorum=hadoophbasemaster.lan:2181</code> in <code>pig.properties</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Time mismanagement</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>client session timed out</p>

<pre><code>  INFO org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer: Expiring session &lt;id&gt;, timeout of 40000ms exceeded
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>ZK and HBase need the same session timeout values

<ul>
<li><code>zoo.cfg</code>: <code>maxSession=Timeout=180000</code></li>
<li><code>hbase-site.xml</code>: <code>zookeeper.session.timeout=180000</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>don&#8217;t co-locate ZK with IO-intense DataNode or RegionServer</li>
<li>specify right amount of heap and tune GC flags

<ul>
<li>turn on parallel/CMS/incremental GC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>clients lose connections</p>

<pre><code>  WARN org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn - Session &lt;id&gt; for server &lt;name&gt;, unexpected error, closing socket connection and attempting reconnect java.io.IOException: Broken pipe
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>don&#8217;t use SSD drive for ZK transaction log</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Disk management</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>unable to load database - unable to run quorum server</p>

<pre><code>  FATAL Unable to load database on disk !  java.io.IOException: Failed to process transaction type: 2 error: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode for &lt;file&gt; at org.apache.zookeeper.server.persistence.FileTxnSnapLog.restore(FileTxnSnapLog.java:152)!
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>archive and wipe <code>/var/zookeeper/version-2</code> if other two ZK servers
are running</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>unable to load database - unreasonable length exception</p>

<pre><code>  FATAL Unable to load database on disk java.io.IOException: Unreasonable length = 1048583 at org.apache.jute.BinaryInputArchive.readBuffer(BinaryInputArchive.java:100)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>server allows a client to set data larger than the server can read from disk</li>
<li>if a znode is not readable, increase <code>jute.maxbuffer</code>

<ul>
<li>look for <code>"Packet len &lt;xx&gt; is out of range"</code> in the client log</li>
<li>increase it by 20%</li>
<li>set in <code>JVMFLAGS="-Djute.maxbuffer=yy" bin/zkCli.sh</code></li>
<li>fixed in ZOOKEEPER-1513</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>failure to follow leader</p>

<pre><code>  WARN org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Learner: Exception when following the leader java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out 
</code></pre>

  <strong>CAUSE:</strong>

<ul>
<li>disk IO contention, network issues</li>
<li>ZK snapshot is too large (lots of ZK nodes)</li>
</ul>


<p>  <strong>SOLVE:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>reduce IO contention by putting dataDir on dedicated spindle</li>
<li>increase initLimit on all ZK servers and restart, see
ZOOKEEPER-1521</li>
<li>monitor network</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<p><strong>DOs</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>separate spindles for dataDir &amp; dataLogDir</li>
<li>allocate 3 or 5 ZK servers</li>
<li>tune garbage collection</li>
<li>run zkCleanup.sh script via cron</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>DON&#8217;Ts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>dont&#8217; co-locate ZK with I/O intense DataNode or RegionServer</li>
<li>don&#8217;t use SSD drive for ZK transaction log</li>
</ul>


<p>You may use Zookeeper as an observer - a non-voting member:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in zoo.cfg</p>

<pre><code>  peerType=observer
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>A o czym będę mówił? Przeklejka ze strony WHUG:</p>

<blockquote><p>Marcin skupi się na współpracy ekosystemu Hadoopa z innymi narzędziami.
Pokaże jak prosto i wygodnie przetwarzać grafy i jak stosować podejście
Big Data, w czasie rzeczywistym. Poruszy również temat łatwiejszego
tworzenia algorytmów Map-Reduce</p>

<p>Będzie to nieco mniej technicza (ale wciąż praktyczna) wycieczka po
obrzeżach tematyki, która jest zwykle poruszana w połączeniu z
Hadoop-em.</p>

<p>Prezentacja będzie dotyczyć narzędzi takich jak Cascading, Storm, Titan.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago I finally received my very own Raspberry Pi board!
Don&#8217;t know what that is? Here, read some at their
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">website</a>.</p>

<p>For the sake of completness let me just describe that as prototyping
platform with ARM processor. It is really similar in concept to what
Arduino is, except it has not that many extensions available (none? or
very little, I&#8217;ve only found those on <a href="http://adafruit.com/">Adafruit</a>
pages).</p>

<p>So, here is the obligatory picture.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/raspberry-pi.jpg" alt="My very own R-Pi" /></p>

<p>It can run a Linux distribution, so anyone familiar with that can have a
go with this low-powered computer.</p>

<p>The board itself is on the market for quite some time now. That&#8217;s why
there are lots of interesting resources and projects that you can do
with that stuff.</p>

<p>Here are just a bunch of them:</p>

<p>Hadoop&#8217;s usage as a big data processing framework gains a lot of attention lately. Now, not only big players see, that they can embrace the data their sites or products are generating and develop their businesses on it. For that to happen two things are needed: the data itself and means of processing really big amounts of it.  </p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/3488314950_453466f762_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<p>Gathering data is relatively easy. These are not necessarily structured data, you don&#8217;t need to plan their usage at first. Just start collecting them and than you may experiment with their potential usage. If they&#8217;ll come out as useless rubbish - deleting them won&#8217;t be hard <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> But imagine the values it may contribute to your business:</p>

<ul>
	<li>faster services - working on optimized data</li>
	<li>more clients - because of more relevant search results</li>
	<li>happy clients - your service can &#8220;read their minds&#8221; <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many companies that utilize Hadoop ecosystem for their own needs. You can read about some of them here: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy</a> But since that page lacks insight into specific applications of Hadoop I&#8217;ve tried to delve into<br/>
details of how Hadoop helped tame some companies&#8217; big data sets.</p>

<EXCERPT>

<h2><a name="test-Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2>

<p>Being a social network provider, a widely used one, they require no introduction. However if you&#8217;ve lived under a rock for last couple years just visit their website <a href="http://facebook.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://facebook.com</a></p>

<p>Their main usage is data warehousing. Since they require to be able to access the data fast and reliably they had a need for real-time querying of their huge, and always growing data set. Their switch from MySQL databases was required due to the increasing workloads they experienced with standard databases. What they got &#8220;out of the box&#8221; with Hadoop was all the benefits of distributed file system (HDFS features). They expanded the ideas behind that even further and implemented truly Highly Available file system without Single Point of Failure.</p>

<p>Facebook has 3 interesting usage scenarios in which Hadoop plays a major role:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Titan - is Facebook&#8217;s messaging system. It processes messages exchanged between users. Ensures that it happens fast and without glitches. Here Hadoop is used mainly as a huge, unlimited storage.</li>
	<li>Puma - Facebook Insights - a tool providing page statistics for  advanced Facebook users. Based on streams of data (clicks, likes, shares, comments and impressions) it graphs those data and makes it available near instantly.</li>
	<li>ODS - Operational Data Store - which stores Facebook&#8217;s internal metrics - collections of OS and cluster health metrics. And it facilitates multiple accounting solutions.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="test-Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2>

<p>This popular micro-blogging platform, where you can register your account and follow friends and celebrities for their micro-messages does some pretty interesting things with their Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>One of their motivations is to speed up their web-page&#8217;s functionality. That is why the compute users&#8217; friendships in Twitter&#8217;s social graph with Hadoop. Using connections between users they calculate their relationship to each other and estimate groups of users.</p>

<p>Since this service&#8217;s users generate lots of content, the company conducts researches based on natural language processing. They probe what could be told about a user from his tweets. They use tweets&#8217; contents for advertisement purpose, trends analysis and many more.</p>

<p>From tweets and user&#8217;s behaviours they characterise usage scenarios. Also, they gather usage statistics, like number of searches daily, number of tweets. Based on this seemingly irrelevant data they run comparisons of different types of users. Twitter analyzes data to determine whether mobile users, users who use third party clients or power users use Twitter differently from average users. Of course theses seem like really specific applications but nevertheless they are very original and base on the data that Twitter has been gathering for some time now. </p>

<h2><a name="test-EBay"></a>EBay</h2>

<p>Being the biggest auctioning site on the Internet, EBay uses Hadoop processing for increasing search relevance based on click-stream data, user data. This seems pretty obvious, considering their area of operation.</p>

<p>However the also have one other interesting thing - they try hard to automatically fill auctioned objects&#8217; metadata, based on the descriptions and other data provided by users. They employ data mining approach for this tasks and judging from their constant growth it seems to work <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<h2><a name="test-LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Social network for professionals, thou a lot smaller than Facebook. Based on click-streams they discover relations between users. All the data concerning latest visits on your profile or people you may know from other places - this comes from Hadoop based analysis of those clicks people make all the time on their sites.</p>

<p>Also a very neat feature, called InMaps (<a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/</a>) analyse declared schools and companies and generates data for graph with clustered friends of yours.</p>

<h2><a name="test-Last.fm"></a>Last.fm</h2>

<p>This on-line radio site, praised by many for its invaluable recommendations&#8217; system seems like a rather small and simple service. But behind the facade of simple web page there are lots of data being processed, so that their services could match a certain level of perfection.</p>

<p>Such large volume of their data comes from scrobbles. Each users of their service listening to a song generates a note about this fact - called scrobble. Based on that and user profiles they calculate global band popularity charts, maps of bands&#8217; popularity and many more usage statistics and timeline charts.</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/7346959440_71648c9fe7_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<h2><a name="test-Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>They just try to detect and trace new patterns in seemingly chaotic data sets. Perhaps you could also do the same? Analyze your data and expand your business value?</p></div>

<p>Suppose you want to add some additional jars to your SoapUI installation. It all should work ok if you put them in <b>bin/ext</b> directory. It is scanned at startup, and jars found there are automatically added to classpath.
</p>

<p>
However if you want to add some JDBC drivers, and happen to be using SoapUI version higher than 3.5.1 it is a bit more tricky.
</p>
<p>You may face this NoClassDefFoundError:<br/>

<pre>
An error occured [oracle/jdbc/Driver], see error log for details
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: oracle/jdbc/Driver
</pre>
</p> 

<p>
If so, try registering your drivers with <b>registerJdbcDriver</b> function, like I did in this snippet of code:
</p>
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1333768.js?file=jdbc-soapui.groovy'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>if (context.sql == null) {
	def driver = 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver'
	com.eviware.soapui.support.GroovyUtils.registerJdbcDriver( driver )
	def sql = Sql.newInstance('jdbc:oracle:thin:' + dbUri, driver)
	context.setProperty('sql', sql)
}</code></pre></noscript></div>



<p>What a crappy thing!</p></div>

    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2011/09/21/what-is-nosql-good-for</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<b>&#8230; or how I ended up writing a CouchDB proof of concept app?</b>

<p>Once upon a time I set out on a journey to discover the NoSQL land.
I&#8217;ve decided that doing simple queries wouldn&#8217;t be interesting enough.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve chose to create an app that would be based on some NoSQL
database.</p>

<p>
The main idea was to create an app, that would dynamically update itself
with geographic data flowing in. Since there are myriads of geo-data
that are available on the internet, you can pick your favorite one and
load them into your SQL database of choice.
</p>

<EXCERPT>
<p>
In my case the primary source of data was a proprietary database, or more specifically - one table in it continuously updated with new data. To make that
data visible on my map I needed to:
</p>

<ul>
<li> buffer the huge amount of those records - so as not to overhoul
other services with large traffic, and not to flood the frontend</li>
<li> convert then to my representation</li>
<li> display them - have presentation layer in a browser - since
browser-based frontend was the easiest and fastest to develop</li>
</ul>

<p>
The idea of the front-end HTML page was to show new points on the map.
From the moment of opening the page records that appear in database
table should be shown interactively on the screen.
</p>

<h2>Toys used</h2>

<p>
For the first step I chose to use RabbitMQ broker. A queue on the broker would receive messages - one message per database table&#8217;s row.
Then I&#8217;d use some simple groovy middle ware to convert the data to appropriate format and put it onto another db - this time db specific
to my app. 
</p>

<p>
You may ask why incorporate another database. It would be
good for separating environments - assuming the original data contains
some vulnerable content that should be anatomised, or we just don&#8217;t feel
comfortable exposing the whole database of some XYZ-system just to have
access to its one table.
</p>

<p>
Since for my presentation layer I chose HTML+JS without any application server-based back-end I&#8217;ve decided on CouchDB . This seemed like
a perfect match for this scenario. Why? - ease of use, REST API, with JSON responses - just great for interacting with my simple front-end.
</p>

<p>
The flow of things was as shown on the image below:
</p>

<IMG src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/gmapper.png"
alt="diagram"/>

<h2>Avro - for the beginning</h2>
<p>
As you can see, I&#8217;ve chosen JSON as my data-format. I&#8217;ve been considering
<a href="http://avro.apache.org">Apache Avro</a> in the first place but
using it was a real pain in the ass. Avro itself is used in <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Apache Hadoop</a> as a serialization
layer, so it would seem OK, but it has virtually <em>no
documentation</em>. But once you tear through the unintuitive interface
and manage to handle all those unthinkable exceptions you get a few pros
for this library. It&#8217;s great in that it does not require code generation - I
like it being made on the fly. It also offers sending data in binary
format, which was not necessary, but never the less is a nice feature.
</p>

<p>
What I certainly didn&#8217;t like about it was its orientation on the files
rather than chunks of data - so it was not so obvious how should I send
data through the wire. 
</p>

<p>
Than I found out it can produce JSON output, which would work for me,
except the output could not have been parsed by other JSON libraries :)
(<a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5375243/jcouchdb-svenson-unable-to-parse-json-string">I&#8217;ve
asked on stackoverflow about that, but with no luck</a>). 
</p>

<p>If my whining haven&#8217;t put you back and still would like to see how to use Avro, try this unit
test in project&#8217;s GitHub repo: <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blob/master/feeder/src/test/groovy/pl/ftang/example/feeder/avro/AvroSimpleTest.groovy">AvroSimpleTest.groovy</a>
</p>


<h2>Svenson</h2>

<p>
I&#8217;ve dropped Avro in favour of a simple JSON lib called (<a
href="http://code.google.com/p/svenson/">Svenson</a> and that was
painless. The only thing I was forced to do was create my model class in
Java - the rest of the project is written in Groovy. I&#8217;ve no idea why
was that necessary, and didn&#8217;t want to look into it.
</p>

<h2>RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>
Further on the way is <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, to which records are filled by a feeding
middle-ware written in Groovy. Since I use <a
href="http://activemq.apache.org">ActiveMQ</a> on a day-to-day basis,
I&#8217;ve decided to try something new. This broker is a really nice piece of
software. Being written in Erlang makes it really fast. What&#8217;s more it
has some extensive capabilities and is easy to approach for anyone
similar with messaging (JMS and friends). For such a lightweight product
it is really powerful - implements AMQP! 
</p>

<h2>CouchDB</h2>

<p>
From the broker&#8217;s queue messages are again fetched by a middle-ware just
to be put into <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> view.
This database is also written in Erlang. It&#8217;s very reliable, however the
way it handles refreshing view isn&#8217;t the most pleasant one -
performance-wise. 
</p>

<p>
Word of advice - if you&#8217;re on Debian derivative, be cautious with
apt-repository version. It&#8217;s rather _ancient_. Also remember to add
<b>allow_jsonp = true</b> to you config file
<i>/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/local.ini</i>. It&#8217;s not enabled by
default, and not having this set would result with empty responses from
the CouchDB server.</p>

<p>The problem here is, that the browser doesn&#8217;t allow quering a web server with hostname other than the one the script originates.
 More on this case <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3386679/connection-ajax-couchdb-and-javascript">here</a>. Seems like my problem could be overcame by changing url in index.html and hostname couchdb listens on to the same address.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ve also created a view, that would expose an event by key: <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blame/master/couchdb/by_date_view.js">view
code</a>
</p>

<h2>Presenting the dots</h2>

<p>
As a back-end I&#8217;ve done some JQuery based AJAX calls - nothing too
fancy. All things necessary for presentation layer are in <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blob/master/index.html">this
file</a>.
</p>

<h2>Things to consider</h2>

<p>
Please bear in mind that this whole application is rather a playground,
not a full-fledged project!! After creating all the parts I have some
doubts about some architectural decisions I made. I don&#8217;t think the
security have been taken into account seriously enough. Also scalability
was never an issue ;-)
</p>

<p>
If you have some thoughts about any of the aspects mentioned in this
post, please feel free to comment or contact me directly :)
</p>

<p>

And also you may try the application by yourself - it&#8217;s on the <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped">GitHub</a>.

<p>&gt;The main idea was to create an app, that would dynamically update itself with geographic data flowing in. <br />
<br />
Not to nitpick, but that doesn&#8217;t seem like an idea for app. I think you should explain what that displayed data is here.  If you moved your &#8216;Presenting the dots&#8217; paragraph just above &#8216;Toys used&#8217;, it would be clear what do you wanted to do with this app.<br />
<br />
&gt;Also remember to add allow_jsonp = true to you config file /opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/local.ini.<br />
<br />
I think you should explain what that option *really* does.<br />
<br />
Other than that, nice post!</p></div>

<p>
I bought a Kindle (3rd generation, Wi-Fi only) some time ago - like half
a year ago. Read some
books, done some web-browsing (awful, quite unpleasant). Gradually I
became more and more curious of other things possible to achieve with
this slate-looking piece of tech. These are my thoughts and ideas.
</p>

<p>
Got a Kindle? Use it every day? Feel like modding or extending your ways
of usage? Great! Read on, and share your thoughts in comments!
</p>

<EXCERPT>

<ol>

<li>
Readability! - This web app is great! Generally this is a simple plug-in
for your browser that will show a little button somewhere on the
toolbar, and if you click it, the page you&#8217;re reading now will be
transformed into nice and sleek content-only page. Look on the screen
below:<br/>

<a href="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/readability_effect.png"><img border="0"
src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/readability_effect_small.png"/></a>
<br/>

This plug-ins additional function is sending to Kindle account. That&#8217;s
the nicest way to read those loads of RSS-sources articles :) The only
limitation is that graphics won&#8217;t be included if resulting file would
exceed allowed size of kindle documents - that&#8217;s 2MB AFAIR.

<b>Install some hacks!</b> - be that serious hacks or rather some simple
software modifications:

<ul>
    <li>read all book formats with Calibre - <a
href="http://www.hacktheday.com/quick-simple-guide-hacking-kindle-nook-ebooks/">link</a></li>
    <li>play Zork on a Kindle!!! - <a

    <li>alternative Kindle keyboard - <a
href="http://hackaday.com/2011/07/28/frankenkindle-building-an-alternate-kindle-keyboard/">link</a></li>
    <li>custom fonts - <a
href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004">link</a></li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><b>Install custom screen-savers</b> - <a
href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Screen_Saver_Hack_for_all_2.x_and_3.x_Kindles">do
this</a> 
to be able to install your own images. &#8230;because you&#8217;ve always wanted
to have some other things on screen when your kindle is in standby mode. Of
course, the original screen-savers look great, but there are only few.
Installing this hack gave me an opportunity to have a multitude of new
images. Now my Kindle looks even better!</li>

<li><b>Try out Chinese kindle software - <a
href="http://www.duokan.com/forum/thread-16541-1-1.html">doukan.com</a></b> -  As a matter
of fact, I haven&#8217;t installed that software yet. It doesn&#8217;t look good
enough for me, and has some minor problems. However this is great, that
there is actually some other option - I&#8217;m not forced to use the official
firmware. And this distribution has many nice features like PDF reflow.</li>

<li><b>Enable Chinese fonts support on your kindle</b> - damn! I&#8217;d like
a simple, step by step tutorial on how to set up chinese fonts on a
kindle. I&#8217;d like to put some font file on my device, fire some
chinese book and be able to see the actual characters..</li>

<li><b>Programming for Kindle</b> - with <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/kdk">Kindle Official SDK</a> - well, not
quite! - unfortunately this is reserved only for the Chosen Ones. I&#8217;ve
applied for the SDK but they
haven&#8217;t sent me my developer key yet, and it&#8217;s been ~2 months. This is
not &#8220;being supportive&#8221; or &#8220;supporting the community&#8221;.</li>

</ol>

<p>
And how do You use your Kindle? Perhaps you&#8217;re doing some serious, crazy
things with it? Share your thoughts!</p></div>

<p>Zgłosiłem się po kindlowe SDK prawie rok temu i niiic, cisza. Widać nie jestem dość cool, by dać mi tę zabawkę do ręki :)<br />
<br />
Co do książek, to fakt, DRM wszędzie. Ale DRM w ebookach działa jak każdy inny (czyli marnie &#8211; da się zdjąć DRM Empiku, Amazona, itp.), więc użytkownik z odrobiną zacięcia da radę.<br />
<br />
PS. Mój kindel  postanowił wyzionąć ducha jakoś w zeszłym tygodniu, na 10 dni przed upływem gwarancji. Kindle znajomej padł ciut (tydzień-dwa?) wcześniej. Amazon bez szemrania wysyła nowe, ale&#8230; nie sposób oprzeć mi się uczuciu, że te urządzonka były obliczone na rok życia. A przynajmniej pierwsza seria z preorderów, obecne są (mam nadzieję) już trwalsze.</p></div>

<p>Też kupowałem kindle ~6 m-cy temu więc się wtrącę:<br />
<br />
Ad  1. Ja kupowałem bezpośrednio w Amazonie i nie zapłaciłem VAT-u (OIDP cła na elektronikę z USA nie ma).<br />
Ad 2.  Przeglądarka IMHO z JS radzi sobie całkiem dobrze, ale jest cholernie wolna i nawigacja jest niewygodna.<br />
Ad 3.  Domyślnie tylko WPA2-PSK, ale jest tam nomalny wpa supplicant więc można edytować sobie konfig i szaleć.<br />
Ad 4. Ja całkiem sporo czytam i ładuje raz na miesiąc, może minimalnie częściej.<br />
Ad 5. Można kupować z Amazona, ja kupuje z Amazon UK, bo kiedy konfigurowałem Kindle to miał niższe ceny książek. Co do DRM to obsługuje tylko swój DRM (czyba azw, czyli mobi + Amazonowy DRM),  z innych trzeba zdjąć DRM i skonwertować na obsługiwany format (Calibre rulez!).</p></div>
</div>
<div class='comment'>
<div class='author'><a href="http://mcl.jogger.pl">Marcin</a></div>
<div class='content'>
<p>Okej, no więc po koleji:<br />
<br />
1. Kupowałem bezpośrednio na Amazon - tyle że na amerykańskim, bo tylko z tamtego ślą Kindle do Polski. Uważam, że to jest najtańsza możliwa opcja. Cło opłaca Amazon, Ty niczym się nie przejmujesz, wszystko jest zrobione za Ciebie. Cała impreza kosztowała mnie coś koło 400zł (Kindle 3 wifi only). Z tego co widziałem to na Allegro jest zdecydowanie drożej.<br />
<br />
2. Przeglądanie stron na Kindlu to tylko w razie naprawdę dużej potrzeby. Mi się nie podoba, wyświetlacz jest na tyle mało responsywny, że swobodne surfowanie po sieci jest niewykonalne. Jak musisz koniecznie coś sprawdzić, to sprawdzisz, ale dla przyjemności to raczej w ten sposób się tego nie robi ;-)<br />
<br />
3. Nie mam dostępu do WPA2 z Radiusem. Używam na WPA2 z PSK - i działa bez zarzutu. Może pogooglaj gdzieś? <br />
<br />
4. To prawda, trzyma miesiąc, tylko trzeba pamiętać żeby Wi-Fi wyłączać, bo nawet na standbaju zrzera baterię.<br />
<br />
5. W Polsce można bez problemu kupować książki z Amazona (nadal, przez Wifi, bo przez 3G to nie wiem). Co do Polskich sklepów, to o ile oferują wspierane przez Kindla formaty, to nie powinno być problemu. Ja osobiście raczej mało książek kupuję na Kindla - korzystam z ogólno dostępnej klasyki + mam osobno kupione PDFy itp. Generalnie nie przeczytasz żadnych książek w pub&#8217;ach ani tym podobnych formatach. Aczkolwiek są na to haki (między innymi chinski software, o którym pisałem).<br />
<br />
W każdym razie polecam zakup, bo naprawdę warto - chyba że wolałbyś coś w stylu IPada (kolory, łatwe surfowanie), to wtedy Kindle nie jest dla Ciebie :)</p></div>

<div class='content'>
<p>Sorry że po polsku, ale przymierzam się do kupna Kindla, i mam parę pytań, wybacz jeśli zaśmiecam ci notkę:<br />
<br />
1. Gdzie kupowałeś bezpośrednio na Amazonie czy przez pośrednika z Allegro, jak z cłem i innymi podatkami? <br />
2. Przeglądarka w Kindle 3 podobno na webkicie, jak w praktyce, dobrze sobie radzi ze stronami, co z JSem?<br />
3. WiFi obsługuje szyfrowanie WPA2 korporacyjne z serwerem RADIUS, czy tylko wersję WPA2 z PSK?<br />
4. Jak z bateryjką, słyszałem że miesiąc daje rady, prawda to?<br />
5. Można w Polandii kupować w Amazonie książki do Kindla? Są jakieś polskie sklepy z polskimi legalnymi ksiażkami, które później bez problemów wrzucę do Kindla, czy przez DRM nie da rady?</p></div>

<p>Some time ago one of the projects at work required me to validate
some Java POJOs. Theses were my model classes and I&#8217;ve been creating
them from incoming WebService requests. One would say that XSD would be
sufficient for the task, for parts of this validations - sure, it would.
But there were some advanced rules XSD would not handle, or would render
the schema document very complicated.</p>

<p>Rules I needed to express were like:

<ul>

<li>person&#8217;s <i>first_name</i> and <i>last_name</i> should be of appropriate length -
between 2 and 20, and additionally one could pass a zero-length string
just to remove the previous value</li>
<li><i>state</i> field should consist only defined values - as in
dictionary value - this one would be completable with XSD&#8217;s
enumerations, but would require often changing schema files and
redistributing them to interested parties :(</li>
</ul>

<p>The library I&#8217;ve decided to use for this task is <a
href="http://oval.sf.net">OVal</a> and it came out really nice! Read on
to find out the details!</p>

<EXCERPT>

<p>Oval is quite mature library that allows POJO validation, but is not
JSR303 (bean validation) implementation. It has converters that enable
it to understand those annotations, but I&#8217;m not sure about the
compatibility.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried only a subset of the available checks, among which
were:</p>

<ul>
<li>NotNull</li>
<li>NotEmpty</li>
<li>Length</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more, and their attributes give interesting ways to
configure the validation process. But using them was rather easy and did
not require to much brainstorming. What I really needed were custom
checks. And in this area OVal shows it&#8217;s strength. Implementing a check
is really easy.</p>

<p>I needed an annotation that would check a field against some values in
a dictionary. If field&#8217;s value was in the given set, than the validation
would succeed, if not, an exception would be thrown. To accomplish this
task it is required to implement two classes: annotation class and check
class - called by the validation engine on a given field.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with our new annotation:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=DictionaryValue.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>import net.sf.oval.configuration.annotation.Constraint;

import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.METHOD})
@Constraint(checkWith = DictionaryValueCheck.class)
public @interface DictionaryValue {
    /**
     * message to be used for the ConstraintsViolatedException
     *
     * @see ConstraintsViolatedException
     */
    String message() default &quot;constraint.DictionaryValue.violated&quot;;

    String file();
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

In the above snippet I&#8217;ve defined a check-annotation, that would be used like
this:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=sample.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>public class Address {
        ....
	@DictionaryValue(file = &quot;/validation/voivodeship.txt&quot;) String state;
        ....
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

You can pass <i>file</i> - containing dictionary values for this field.
There is also <i>message</i> field in the annotation which is an error
message returned by the validation engine of failed check - pretty
handy. And can be expressed in <i>.properties</i> file as:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=validation.properties'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>constraint.DictionaryValue.violated={context} is not among allowed dictionary values</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

<p>Placeholder, like <i>context</i>, will be replaced with correct values supplied by the
validation engine.</p>

Annotating a field is not enough. It is also needed to create a validator
for this kind of check. The name of the class is already defined in
<i>DictionaryValue</i> annotation, it is called
<i>DictionaryValueCheck</i> and I&#8217;ve done this check this way:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=DictionaryValueCheck.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>import net.sf.oval.Validator;
import net.sf.oval.configuration.annotation.AbstractAnnotationCheck;
import net.sf.oval.context.OValContext;
import net.sf.oval.exception.OValException;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class DictionaryValueCheck extends AbstractAnnotationCheck&lt;DictionaryValue&gt; {

    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(DictionaryValueCheck.class);

    private String file;

    Map&lt;String, String&gt; dictionary;

    @Override
	public void configure(final DictionaryValue constraintAnnotation) {
		super.configure(constraintAnnotation);
		setFile(constraintAnnotation.file());
	}

    private void setFile(String file) {
        this.file = file;
        dictionary = loadDictionaryFrom(file);
        requireMessageVariablesRecreation();
    }

    private Map&lt;String, String&gt; loadDictionaryFrom(String file) {
        String fileStr;
        Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
        try {
            fileStr = IOUtils.toString(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(file));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            log.error(&quot;Error loading file: &quot;, e);
            return map;
        }
        for (String line : fileStr.split(&quot;\n&quot;)) {
            if (line.trim().length() == 0)
                continue;
            String[] tokens = line.split(&quot; &quot;, 2); // we want 2 substrings max
            if (tokens.length == 2)
                map.put(tokens[0], tokens[1]);
            if (tokens.length == 1)
                map.put(tokens[0], null);
        }
        return map;
    }

    public boolean isSatisfied(Object validatedObject, Object valueToValidate, OValContext context, Validator validator) throws OValException {
        if (valueToValidate == null)
            return true;
        return dictionary.containsKey(valueToValidate);
    }
}
</code></pre></noscript></div>


What this basically does is:
<ol>
<li>when <i>file</i> is set - read dictionary content from the file into
map</li>
<li>upon check request just lookup value in dictionary parsed from the
input file</li>
</ol>

<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>

<p>For me Oval is really great tool. With it at ones disposal it is extremely easy to create any
imaginable validation you need. This library is really easy to use and
offers lots of handy features.</p>

<p>But perhaps I&#8217;m reinventing the wheel and all this can be done easily
with some other library? Share Your opinion!</p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s a great question. I&#8217;ve forgotten to write about this, but OVal offers profiles, which you can disable or enable whenever you like. You set a profile for a specific annotation. In your case let&#8217;s assume You have two operations: add and update. Your model has field annotated with @NotNull(profile=&quot;UPDATE&quot;), which means we don&#8217;t want null values on it when updating. In _add_ operation you disable the profile called UPDATE, so the annotation is also disabled. When calling _update_ you enable the profile and the validation is performed. <br />

<p>Question:<br />
Say, we have an object with a primary key, that is mandatory (in the database), but described as AUTOINCREMENT. When client sends new object data, the primary key is obviously null, but we need to validate it for not-nullity in other cases.<br />
<br />
Doea OVal handle variations / directions of validation?</p></div>

<p>And now for part 2 of my visit to Geecon 2011!</p>
<EXCERPT>
<h2>1. <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim Webber</a> &#8220;Revisiting SOA for the 21st
century&#8221;</h2>

<p>Now this was awesome! Jim Webber, a former <a
href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> employee, now
Neo4j evangelist (in <a href="http://neotechnology.com/">Neotechnology</a>) described his views
on how SOA should look - according to him. This was presented
previously, on other occasions as his &#8220;Guerilla SOA&#8221; talk - generally he
advocated for REST based services, loose contracts (stating that WSDLs
are too verbose and code generation is evil).</p>

<p>Jim mentioned Martin Fowler&#8217;s article on integration databases but I
couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere - thou the topic looks interesting. He also
recommended <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a> and exposing tests on the web for the end
user to use them as early as possible.</p>

<p> One big point he made his case with was <b>not relying on enterprise
software</b>. Simple tools can do much better job. He compared
implementing Web Services security (Secured SOAP over HTTP over TCP IP)
to REST based service accessed through <i>HTTPS</i> - basic and easily
testable with tools like <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>.</p>

<p>Great talk. One of the best!</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://blog.staffannoteberg.com/">Staffan Noteberg</a> &#8220;Regex - the future
programming&#8221;</h2>

<p>I must confess, that this did not go too well. The whole talk was
well prepared and laid out but it lacked depth. It was pretty basic
introduction to regex. From the presentation&#8217;s subject I was rather
prepared for some novel uses of regex - like for example: showing how to
filter big volume of data with simple regex or sth.</p>

<p>But the talk was fun, Staffan is a good speaker. He is also an author
of <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"> pomodoro technique</a> book - I intend to read sth abut
this technique and this may be a nice start</p>

<h2>3. Bartosz Kowalewski &#8220;Is OSGI ready for wide
adoption?&#8221;</h2>

<p>If it comes to titles I tend to rely on them pretty heavily, however
strange it may seem. This time I also did - and the whole talk did not
give me a definitive answer to the stated question.</p>

<p>Sure, the presentation was informative, but it described some OSGI
specific, quite low level stuff. Of course, if you want to use OSGI -
even by leveraging application server with OSGI under the hood - you
should know a fair bit about the technology itself. Even thou the AS
does a good job of hiding OSGI container specifics from the developer,
in case of problems it&#8217;s better to be well informed. All in all - the
talk gave too little information for me.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/company/people/Pech_Vaclav.html">Vaclav Pech</a> &#8220;Pick low hanging fruit&#8221;</h2>

<p><b>&#8220;Parallelism is not hard, multithreading is&#8221;</b> - this was the
key sentence of the presentation. The speaker showed how to introduce
concurrency into normal java/groovy code by sprinkling it with
concurrency powder. Easy enough! With <a
href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a> library he
showed:</p>

<ul>
<li>running processing tasks with thread pools</li>
<li>testing concurrent code</li>
<li>Fork/join Thread Pool - multiple thread queues (note to self:
fork/join is good for hierarchical problems)</li>
<li>low-hanging fruits:<br>

    <ul>
    <li>async calculations</li>
    <li>fork/join</li>
    <li>dataflow</li>
    <li>parallel collection processing</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Actors are great - use <a
href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a> or <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>,
is sufficient to use <i>@ActiveMethod</i> and <i>@ActiveObject</i>
annotations and Actors are usable in OO-world</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Good talk, well received!</p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/antonarhipov">Anton Arhipov</a> &#8220;Bytecode for discriminating
developers&#8221;</h2>

<p>Technical introduction to the world of bytecode, jvm specification
details. I&#8217;ve drifted away to some other topics - really - can&#8217;t recall
what this was all about.</p>

<h2>6. <a href="http://jroller.com/aalmiray/">Andreas Almiray</a> &#8220;Polyglot Programming&#8221;</h2>

<p>This was a nice talk covering Groovy, Scala and Closure. The whole
point of it was to show how cool it is to play with emerging JVM
languages. They are not only fun but also useful. What&#8217;s more, they
bring freshness to java world, injecting it with some new paradigms and
methodologies. It is easier to incorporate new ideas into younger JVM
languages than to the mature Java.</p>

<h2>7. <a href="http://jim.webber.name/">Jim Webber</a> &#8220;A pragmatic introduction to
Neo4j&#8221;</h2>

<p>And Jim Webber again, this time with some <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> evangelism. First
came some taxonomy information on NoSQL databases (Not Only SQL) as a
whole - than some specific examples of problems solvable with graph
databases - and Neo4j is a graph database. </p>

<p> Main points of Jim&#8217;s talk were:
<ul>
<li>sharding a database is important for scalability</li>
<li>series data - should be OK to use Neo4j as their storage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These were all the sessions I attended. On Saturday there was a
Hacker-garden, but neither I had time nor will to stay - the topics were
very interesting and I&#8217;d definitely like to experience such an event,
but after 2 days of continuous talks I was rather tired.</p>

<p>To sum up, 2011&#8217;s Geecon was a great experience, with lots of
interesting talks and lots of new inspirations. Keep up the good work
guys!</p></div>
