Some time ago, I&#8217;ve attended <a href="http://meetbsd.org/">MeetBSD</a>
conference in Kraków. This BSD event is held yearly in either Warsaw, or
Kraków. Due to relatively small group of people that registered there
was only one track, which had both good and bad sides - you didn&#8217;t have
to choose from myriads of lectures, but there was no way to skip boring
ones either. Well, I guess this kind of niche conference - about
operating system :) - will not attract bigger attention.</p>

<center><a href="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/DSC06777.JPG"><img
src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/DSC06777.JPG" width="350"
border="0"/></a></center>

<EXCERPT/>

<h3>DAY 1</h3>

<p>It took place on 2nd-3rd of July, 2010, so this
review is rather dated :) However, I&#8217;d like to keep this as reminder.
I&#8217;ve arrived to the conference site, which was located in building of
the <a
href="http://www.ii.uj.edu.pl/index.php?page=lokalizacja-instytutu&hl=pol">Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science</a>
a few minutes after the official start of the conference. I had been
traveling from Warsaw the same day, and the only train that would not
require me to get up at some night hour would arrive a bit too late. Oh
well :)
</p>

<p>
I grabbed a tea and some biscuits and entered the series of lectures.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to listen to was a <b>Welcome intro</b> - quite nice
one. Conducted by a guy from Cisco (AFAIK). He was talking about the
opportunities for Kraków and how it will become a Polish Silicon Valley
in near future, etc. Actually I don&#8217;t share his believes but the talk
was ok. 
</p>

<p>
Then came Dru Lavigne with some insight into <b>BSD Certification</b>
program. Actually, does anybody use this? Come one. Do we really need
another certification process? I for sure don&#8217;t see the need, especially
for the BSD community.  However the trend is good, may help popularize
BSDs among enterprise leaders, because if something is certified, than
it can be used in big enterprises, right? :)
</p></p>

<p>
Sławek Żak talked about <b>NoSQL</b>. Although the talk gave a bit of
info about what the idea is and how does it compare to normal DBs, I did
not find his presentation entertaining. In my opinion, there was not
enough emphasis on the difference in usage for such databases. The talk
about NoSQL I&#8217;d attended on <a
href="http://mcl.jogger.pl/2010/06/27/javarsovia-2010/">Javarsovia</a> was a lot better.
</p>

<p>
Next talk, presented by Attilio Rao was very, very technical. It was
about &#8220;VFS/Vnode interface in FreeBSD&#8221;. It was rather an API
presentation, and introduction on how to implement an FS in FreeBSD
infrastructure, than a conference talk. This kind of presentation would
be good suited for FreeBSD kernel developers not sysadmins.
</p>
<p>
Jakub Klama&#8217;s talk on the process of <b>porting FreeBSD to Da Vinci</b>
embedded system was interesting. It had some photos of the board,
tackled a few technical corners, but caught my attention. Well done!
</p>
<p>
Out guy among FreeBSD hackers - Paweł Jakub Dawidek - gave speech about
<b>HAST - High Availability STorage</b>. In other words he implemented
<a href="http://www.drbd.org/">DRBD</a> for FreeBSD. Sadly, for me this
is just catching up with what Linux has in mainline since 2.6.33 (it was
working very well even before that). It&#8217;s not so feature rich as DRBD,
but the project is slowly maturing.  Nevertheless, it&#8217;s good to finally have this on board.
</p>
<p>
Then an inconspicuous guy come onto the stage. Came from Bulgaria, named
Nikolay Aleksandrov, that guy gave a talk titled <b>Developing high
speed FreeBSD</b>. And the subject was astounding. He works for a major
Bulgarian ISP and due to lack of cash to buy some serious networking
gear, he wrote a FreeBSD extension that would sit in-between network
adapter and the kernel and do all the hard work like routing, VLANs, and
more. His goal was to make it lighting fast, and as far as his results
showed, he succeeded. This talk was really amazing, he did what would
normally take hundreds of thousands of dollars - in cash and skills - in
his free time, or at least as a pet project.
</p>

<h3>DAY 2</h3>

<p>
Well, I&#8217;d skipped the first lecture of the day, because of laziness ;)
</p>

<p>
Had decide to pack myself and arrive to listen about <b>what can freebsd
borrow from AIX</b>. Jan Srzednicki talked about some nice tools from
the AIX world. He proposed that adding an educational, console-based
tool for conducting basic (and even not so basic) tasks, would encourage
people to learn the system. I think it would work. However the rest of
his ideas weren&#8217;t good enough - at least not for me.
</p>

<p>
Next thing in line was <b>The new USB stack</b>. Interesting talk about
new USB stack development, conducted by Hans Petter Selasky.
  This guy was really passionate about USB things ;-)</p>

<p>
Martin Matuska presented his set of shell scripts that allow to create
<b>mfsBSD</b> - an in-memory FreeBSD install. Since I&#8217;m already doing
this kind of things with <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, the talk was entertaining.  
</p>

<p>
Marcko Zec and <b>Network stack virtualization</b>. This was about
extending FreeBSD to be able to create  lots of compartmentalized
environments with their own network stacks. As noted in the
presentation: the solution still has problems with
  graceful shutdown of the stack. Still not stable enough - but very
  promising.
</p>

<p>The closing presentation, given by Warner Losh (<b>very</b>
knowledgeable guy behing <a
href="http://bsdimp.blogspot.com">bsdimp.blogspot.com</a>) on the
subject <b>Using FreeBSD in a commercial settings</b>. The talk was not
what I&#8217;ve expected, but nevertheless was very interesting. It was about
branching and merging back changes in case of using FreeBSD as a base
for some commercial products. This could be easily applied to any other
Open Source project. Warner described possible strategies for branching
and performing merges, he noted also pros and cons of all the described
solutions.
</p>

<p>
All in all, that was a fun time. Even thou I don&#8217;t use any BSD as my
primary system at this time, and my BSD skills are a bit rusty, the
talks were nice enough :) for a hobbist like me.</p>
