    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HBase is by design a columnar store, that is optimized for random reads.
You just ask for a row using rowId as an identifier and you get your
data instantaneously.</p>

<p>Performing a scan on part or whole table is a completely different thing.
First of all, it is sequential. Meaning it is rather slow, because it
doesn't use all the RegionServers at the same time. It is implemented
that way to realize the contract of Scan command - which has to return
results sorted by key.</p>

<p>So, how to do this efficiently?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The usual way of getting data from HBase is with the help of its API,
mainly Scan objects. To accomplish the task I'll use just them. I'll
specify startRow and stopRow, so that each Scan request will be looking
through only part of the key space.</p>

<p>It is crucial to note, that this whole solution works because of key
sorting properties in HBase. So, HBase scans a table according to ascending key
values. Since keys are of String type, key with value "1" is smaller
than "2", because they are sorted lexicographicly. So, also key with value "12345" is smaller than "2". I've
leveraged this property so that I've partitioned my whole key space according to
the first character of the key. In my case keys contain only digits. So I
have 10 ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li>null-1</li>
<li>1-2</li>
<li>2-3</li>
<li>3-4</li>
<li>4-5</li>
<li>5-6</li>
<li>6-7</li>
<li>7-8</li>
<li>8-9</li>
<li>9-null</li>
</ul>


<p>The speedup comes from the fact, that each range resides in its own
partition. That's right, I've presplit the table to have 10 partitions.
This corresponds rather nicely with my cluster's setup, because I have
more than 10 RegionServers. So every partition should be on different
RegionServer. It will allow the code to do the requested scan operations
in parallel - giving me this exact performance boost.</p>

<p>How I've created the input table:</p>

<p><code></p>

<p>$ create 'tariff_changes', { NAME => 'cf', SPLITS_FILE => 'splits.txt', VERSIONS => 50, MAX_FILESIZE => 1073741824 }</p>

<p>$ alter 'tariff_changes', { NAME => 'cf', SPLITS_FILE => 'splits.txt', VERSIONS => 50, MAX_FILESIZE => 1073741824 }</p>

<p></code></p>

<p>Split file is just something along this lines:</p>

<p><code>
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
0
</code></p>

<p>This tells HBase what are the rowKeys starting and ending each of the
partitions.</p>

<p>Ok, so after this rather lengthy introduction, what the actual code
does? It just spins of a few threads - one for each partition - and runs
a Scan request tailored to that partitions key space. This way, I got a
10x speedup for this particular scan. The execution time went down from
30 minutes to 3 for my use case.</p>

<p>I've created an example implementation of this idea. You can find it on
GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-distributed-search">https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-distributed-search</a>.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to speed things up even more with HBase?</p>

    <link href="http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/12/08/simple-hbase-orm/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-08T21:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2013/12/08/simple-hbase-orm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When dealing with data stored in HBase, you are quick to come to a
conclusion, that it is extremaly inconvenient to reach to it
via HBase native API. It is very verbose and you always need to convert
between bytes and simple types - a pain.</p>

<p>While I was working on a project of mine, I thought, why not to easy
those pains and fetch real objects from HBase.</p>

<p>And that's how this simplistic, hackish ORM came to life. It is no match
for projects like <a href="https://github.com/impetus-opensource/Kundera">Kundera</a>
(a JPA compliant solution), or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/n-orm/">n-orm</a>. Nevertheless, it just suits my needs :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Project sources are hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-annotations">https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-annotations</a></p>

<p>To make use of this, you need to have an entity class with annotations:</p>

<ul>
<li>@Column - with argument specifying column family and column name, ie.
@Column("cf:column-name")</li>
<li>@Id - will store row key in this property,</li>
<li>and optionaly @Value - for Spring Expression Language, in case you
need to perform some extraction on the value.</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Annotations should be on setter methods.</em></p>

<p>Now you have your model annotated and ready to be fetched from HBase.</p>

<p>The actual work is done with a service class, that should extend class
<a href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-annotations/blob/master/src/main/java/pl/touk/hadoop/hbase/BaseHadoopInteraction.java">BaseHadoopInteraction</a> just as class
<a href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/hbase-annotations/blob/master/src/test/java/pl/touk/hadoop/hbase/SampleHBaseClient.java">SimpleHBaseClient</a> does.</p>

<p>Then it is possible to just call:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zygm0nt/7863407.js"></script>


<p>Note that there are more methods you can use on BaseHadoopInteraction.
You can also do:</p>

<ul>
<li>scan</li>
<li>scan with key ranges</li>
<li>delete</li>
</ul>


<p>What you won't get from this simple ORM is:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic object updating,</li>
<li>nested objects,</li>
<li>saving to HBase - 'cause I didn't have a need for that,</li>
</ul>


<p>Hope you'll find this piece of code useful. If you see room for
improvements while staying in project's scope - please drop me a
message.</p>

<p>And if you are searching for a full-fledged ORM solution for interacting with HBase, just head
straight to Kundera project website :)</p>
