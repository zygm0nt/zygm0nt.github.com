<p>This small conference had its third installment in (http://www.polin.pl/en)[Polin - Museum of the History of Polish Jews]. Organizing Scala conference isn't that obvious and having that kind of attention is really great - all the foreign speakers, etc.</p>

<p>Here is a quick recap of presentations I've attended.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Having a cake ... - by Paweł Szulc</h3>

<p>A keynote about typeclasses. I've read the slides before the presentation  -and they are available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/paulszulc/introduction-to-type-classes-in-30-min">here</a>, so it wasn't new to me. But I'd strongly recommend to watch this talk.</p>

<p>Also, there is another nice talk by Paweł: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENtdZ9MBo5Y"> Category theory is absolute general nonsense!</a> This talk is in Polish only.</p>

<h3>EFF Monad - by Eric Torreborre</h3>

<p>Different way of monadic composition, implemented in a separate library: <a href="https://github.com/atnos-org/eff-cats">eff-cats</a> (there is also scalaz alternative). Technically it was a bit over my head, but after experimenting with the concept at home it seems interesting.</p>

<p>I liked that Eric, being Zalando employee, developed that for their internal usage. Also the beauty of easily constructing different technological stacks with consistent API is very tempting.</p>

<p>Interesting things used/mentioned were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="github.com/non/kind-projector">non/kind-projector</a>- for projections</li>
<li><a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/?post_type=publication&amp;p=319">Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Incremental compiler - by Krzysztof Romanowski</h3>

<p>Deep dive into scalac incremental compiler implementation. While the presentation itself, the way it was presented, was very nice, I didn't particularly enjoy the topic. It seemed more appropriate for tools' developers.</p>

<h3>Akka cluster with Etcd - by Maciej Biłas</h3>

<p>This one looked promising. Joining multiple exciting technologies seems often that way. Unfortunately it was rather tech preview of Kubernetes app setup rather than Scala presentation.</p>

<p>I'm a bit disappointed, because looking through the sources of the project <a href="https://github.com/rkrzewski/akka-cluster-etcd">akka-cluster-etcd</a> there are lots of things to describe. Kubernetes not being one of them ;-)</p>

<h3>Shapeless? Easy! - by Valentin Kasas</h3>

<p>Well, that was a clear introduction to shapeless. Till this presentation I've treated shapeless as only some vague thingy you use when writing libraries. Valentin proved otherwise.</p>

<p>He gave a clear and consistent tutorial on the basics of shapeless and its potential use in some example applications. He created a simple diff tool. Not that useful in real life application, but definitely helped make a point.</p>

<p>Will look into real life examples in near future.</p>

<p>Fun fact: The speaker had his presentation in <a href="https://github.com/marconilanna/REPLesent">REPLesent</a>, a sbt plugin for presentations - and performed most of the slide-jumping-fu with just one hand, other held in his pocket :D Looked quite hilarious.</p>

<p>Valentin also mentioned shapeless' typeclass derivation - this actually looks nice! Have a look at this <a href="https://meta.plasm.us/posts/2015/11/08/type-classes-and-generic-derivation/">question</a></p>

<h3>Cool Toolz in the Scalaz and Cats Toolboxes - by Jan Pustelnik</h3>

<p>Functional Design Patterns - enjoyable talk. With a bit of theoretical background, lots of useful use-cases. The talk was about cats and scalaz - both being very similar, and patterns they contain.</p>

<p>Key points being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functor pattern for abstracting Big Data computations, to achieve easier testability</li>
<li>composing functors - |@| scream operator - also know (officially) as Applicative Builder</li>
<li>Applicative  - a list of computation into a computation of lists, list traversal</li>
<li>Applicative pattern for reading config</li>
</ul>


<p>There is this nice video called "A purely functional approach to building large applications". Go see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS3IlDBDlvo">it</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To conclude - the conference was really great. Both the talks and social side of the event were enjoyable. I've been blown away by the great architecture of the museum itself. Been there a couple times and enjoyed all of them.</p>

<p>The much needed change would be to bring more tracks, because sometimes topics were too specific and I'd gladly change lecture to some other.</p>

<p>As for the usual conference merch, there were no bags with leaflets and pens etc. It came as a surprise to me, but I also really liked it. People infact throw away most of the contents from such bags. Also, no t-shirt as a default - great idea! If you like it - just buy one, otherwise don't bother.</p>

<p>Overall - great job Softwaremill! Keep up the good work!.</p>
