    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2012/10/30/hadoop-ha</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of Hadoop's 2.x version, there finally is a working
High-Availability solution. Even two of those. Now it really is easy to
configure and use those solutions. It no longer require external
components, like
<a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2009/07/hadoop-ha-configuration/">DRBD</a>.
It all is just neatly packed into Cloudera Hadoop distribution - the
precursor of this solution.</p>

<p>Read on to find out how to use it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The most important weakness of previous Hadoop releases was the
single-point-of-failure, which happend to be NameNode. NameNode as a key
component of every Hadoop cluster, is responsible for managing
filesystem namespace information and block location. Loosing its data results in loosing all the data
stored on DataNodes. HDFS is no longer able to reach for specific files,
or its blocks. This renders your cluster inoperable.</p>

<p>So it is crucial to be able to detect and counter problems with NameNode.
The most desirable behavior is to have a hot backup, that would ensure
a no-downtime cluster operation. To achieve this, the second NameNode
need to have up-to-date information on filesystem metadata and it needs
to be also up and running. Starting NameNode with existing set of data
may easily take many minutes to parse the actual filesystem state.</p>

<p>Previously used solution - depoying SecondaryNameNode - was somewhat
flawed. It took long time to recover after failure. It was not a
hot-backup solution, which also added to the problem. Some other
solution was required.</p>

<p>So, what needed to be made redundant is the edits dir contents and
sending block location maps from each of the DataNodes to NameNodes -
in case of HA deployment - to both NameNodes. This was accomplished in
two steps. The first one with the release of CDH 4 beta - solution based
on sharing edits directory. Than, with CDH 4.1 came quorum based solution.</p>

<p>Find out how to configure those on your cluster.</p>

<h2>Shared edits directory solution</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/hadoop_ha-nfs.png" alt="Hadoop HA - NFS based edits share" /></p>

<p>For this kind of setup, there is an assumption, that in a cluster exists
a shared storage directory. It should be deployed using some kind of
network-based filesystem. You could try with NFS or GlusterFS.</p>

  &lt;value&gt;hdfs://example-cluster&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3958555.js?file=hdfs-site.xml'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!-- common server name --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.nameservices&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;example-cluster&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- HA configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.namenodes.example-cluster&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;nn1,nn2&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.rpc-address.example-cluster.nn1&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;master1:8020&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.rpc-address.example-cluster.nn2&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;master2:8020&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.http-address.example-cluster.nn1&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;0.0.0.0:50070&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.http-address.example-cluster.nn2&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;0.0.0.0:50070&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Storage for edits' files --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;file:///mnt/filer1/dfs/ha-name-dir-shared&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Client failover --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.example-cluster&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Fencing configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.fencing.methods&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;sshfence&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
 &lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;


&lt;!-- Automatic failover configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ha.zookeeper.quorum&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This setup is quite OK, as long as you're comfortable with maintaining a
separate service (network storage) for handling the HA state. It seems
error prone to me, because it adds another service which high
availability should be ensured. NFS seems to be a bad choice here,
because AFAIK it does not offer HA out of the box.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have GlusterFS, which is a distributed filesystem,
you can deploy on multiple bricks and increase the replication level.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it still brings additional burden of another service to
maintain.</p>

<h2>Quorum based solution</h2>

<p><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/hadoop_ha-quorum.png" alt="Hadoop HA - Quorum based edits share" /></p>

<p>With the release of CDH 4.1.0 we are now able to use a much better
integrated solution called JournalNode. Now all the updates are
synchronized through a JournalNode. Each JournalNode have the same data
and all the NameNodes are able to recive filesystem state updates from
that daemons.</p>

<p>This solution is much more consistent with Hadoop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Please note, that the config is almost identical to the one needed for
shared edits directory solution. The only difference is the value for
<em>dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir</em>. This now points to all the journal
nodes deployed in our cluster.</p>

&lt;/property&gt;


&lt;!-- Automatic failover configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ha.zookeeper.quorum&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>

<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<p>In both cases you need to run Zookeeper-based Failover Controller
(<em>hadoop-hdfs-zkfc</em>). This daemon negotiates which NameNode should
become active and which standby.</p>

<p>But that's not all. Depending on the way you've choosen to deploy HA you
need to do some other things:</p>

<h2>Shared edits dir</h2>

<p>With shared edits dir you need to deploy networked filesystem, and mount
it on your NameNodes. After that you can run your cluster and be happy
with your new HA.</p>

<h2>Quroum based</h2>

<p>For QJournal to operate you need to install one new package called
<em>hadoop-hdfs-journalnode</em>. This provides startup scripts for Journal
Node daemons. Choose at least three nodes that will be responsible for
handling edits state and deploy journal nodes on them.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Thanks to guys from Cloudera we now can use an enterprise grade High
Availability features for Hadoop. Eliminating the single point of
failure in your cluster is essential for easy maintainability of your
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Given the above choices, I'd suggest using QJournal setup, becasue of
its relatively small impact on the overal cluster architecture. It's
good performance and fairly simple setup enable the users to easily
start using Hadoop in HA setup.</p>

<p>Are you using Hadoop with HA? What are your impressions?</p>

<p>Hadoop's usage as a big data processing framework gains a lot of attention lately. Now, not only big players see, that they can embrace the data their sites or products are generating and develop their businesses on it. For that to happen two things are needed: the data itself and means of processing really big amounts of it.  </p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/3488314950_453466f762_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<p>Gathering data is relatively easy. These are not necessarily structured data, you don't need to plan their usage at first. Just start collecting them and than you may experiment with their potential usage. If they'll come out as useless rubbish - deleting them won't be hard <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> But imagine the values it may contribute to your business:</p>

<ul>
    <li>faster services - working on optimized data</li>
    <li>more clients - because of more relevant search results</li>
    <li>happy clients - your service can "read their minds" <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many companies that utilize Hadoop ecosystem for their own needs. You can read about some of them here: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy</a> But since that page lacks insight into specific applications of Hadoop I've tried to delve into<br/>
details of how Hadoop helped tame some companies' big data sets.</p>

<EXCERPT>

<h2><a name="test-Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2>

<p>Being a social network provider, a widely used one, they require no introduction. However if you've lived under a rock for last couple years just visit their website <a href="http://facebook.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://facebook.com</a></p>

<p>Their main usage is data warehousing. Since they require to be able to access the data fast and reliably they had a need for real-time querying of their huge, and always growing data set. Their switch from MySQL databases was required due to the increasing workloads they experienced with standard databases. What they got "out of the box" with Hadoop was all the benefits of distributed file system (HDFS features). They expanded the ideas behind that even further and implemented truly Highly Available file system without Single Point of Failure.</p>

<p>Facebook has 3 interesting usage scenarios in which Hadoop plays a major role:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Titan - is Facebook's messaging system. It processes messages exchanged between users. Ensures that it happens fast and without glitches. Here Hadoop is used mainly as a huge, unlimited storage.</li>
    <li>Puma - Facebook Insights - a tool providing page statistics for  advanced Facebook users. Based on streams of data (clicks, likes, shares, comments and impressions) it graphs those data and makes it available near instantly.</li>
    <li>ODS - Operational Data Store - which stores Facebook's internal metrics - collections of OS and cluster health metrics. And it facilitates multiple accounting solutions.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="test-Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2>

<p>This popular micro-blogging platform, where you can register your account and follow friends and celebrities for their micro-messages does some pretty interesting things with their Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>One of their motivations is to speed up their web-page's functionality. That is why the compute users' friendships in Twitter's social graph with Hadoop. Using connections between users they calculate their relationship to each other and estimate groups of users.</p>

<p>Since this service's users generate lots of content, the company conducts researches based on natural language processing. They probe what could be told about a user from his tweets. They use tweets' contents for advertisement purpose, trends analysis and many more.</p>

<p>From tweets and user's behaviours they characterise usage scenarios. Also, they gather usage statistics, like number of searches daily, number of tweets. Based on this seemingly irrelevant data they run comparisons of different types of users. Twitter analyzes data to determine whether mobile users, users who use third party clients or power users use Twitter differently from average users. Of course theses seem like really specific applications but nevertheless they are very original and base on the data that Twitter has been gathering for some time now. </p>

<h2><a name="test-EBay"></a>EBay</h2>

<p>Being the biggest auctioning site on the Internet, EBay uses Hadoop processing for increasing search relevance based on click-stream data, user data. This seems pretty obvious, considering their area of operation.</p>

<p>However the also have one other interesting thing - they try hard to automatically fill auctioned objects' metadata, based on the descriptions and other data provided by users. They employ data mining approach for this tasks and judging from their constant growth it seems to work <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<h2><a name="test-LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Social network for professionals, thou a lot smaller than Facebook. Based on click-streams they discover relations between users. All the data concerning latest visits on your profile or people you may know from other places - this comes from Hadoop based analysis of those clicks people make all the time on their sites.</p>

<p>Also a very neat feature, called InMaps (<a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/</a>) analyse declared schools and companies and generates data for graph with clustered friends of yours.</p>

<h2><a name="test-Last.fm"></a>Last.fm</h2>

<p>This on-line radio site, praised by many for its invaluable recommendations' system seems like a rather small and simple service. But behind the facade of simple web page there are lots of data being processed, so that their services could match a certain level of perfection.</p>

<p>Such large volume of their data comes from scrobbles. Each users of their service listening to a song generates a note about this fact - called scrobble. Based on that and user profiles they calculate global band popularity charts, maps of bands' popularity and many more usage statistics and timeline charts.</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/7346959440_71648c9fe7_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<h2><a name="test-Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>They just try to detect and trace new patterns in seemingly chaotic data sets. Perhaps you could also do the same? Analyze your data and expand your business value?</p></div>

However if you want to add some JDBC drivers, and happen to be using SoapUI version higher than 3.5.1 it is a bit more tricky.
</p>
<p>You may face this NoClassDefFoundError:<br/>

<pre>
An error occured [oracle/jdbc/Driver], see error log for details
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: oracle/jdbc/Driver
</pre>
</p> 

<p>
If so, try registering your drivers with <b>registerJdbcDriver</b> function, like I did in this snippet of code:
</p>
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1333768.js?file=jdbc-soapui.groovy'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>if (context.sql == null) {
	def driver = 'oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver'
	com.eviware.soapui.support.GroovyUtils.registerJdbcDriver( driver )
	def sql = Sql.newInstance('jdbc:oracle:thin:' + dbUri, driver)
	context.setProperty('sql', sql)
}</code></pre></noscript></div>



<p>What a crappy thing!</p></div>
