    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the advent of Hadoop's 2.x version, there finally is a working
High-Availability solution. Even two of those. Now it really is easy to
configure and use those solutions. It no longer require external
components, like
<a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2009/07/hadoop-ha-configuration/">DRBD</a>.
It all is just neatly packed into Cloudera Hadoop distribution - the
precursor of this solution.</p>

<p>Read on to find out how to use it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The most important weakness of previous Hadoop releases was the
single-point-of-failure, which happend to be NameNode. NameNode as a key
component of every Hadoop cluster, is responsible for managing
filesystem namespace information and block location. Loosing its data results in loosing all the data
stored on DataNodes. HDFS is no longer able to reach for specific files,
or its blocks. This renders your cluster inoperable.</p>

<p>So it is crucial to be able to detect and counter problems with NameNode.
The most desirable behavior is to have a hot backup, that would ensure
a no-downtime cluster operation. To achieve this, the second NameNode
need to have up-to-date information on filesystem metadata and it needs
to be also up and running. Starting NameNode with existing set of data
may easily take many minutes to parse the actual filesystem state.</p>

<p>Previously used solution - depoying SecondaryNameNode - was somewhat
flawed. It took long time to recover after failure. It was not a
hot-backup solution, which also added to the problem. Some other
solution was required.</p>

<p>So, what needed to be made redundant is the edits dir contents and
sending block location maps from each of the DataNodes to NameNodes -
in case of HA deployment - to both NameNodes. This was accomplished in
two steps. The first one with the release of CDH 4 beta - solution based
on sharing edits directory. Than, with CDH 4.1 came quorum based solution.</p>

<p>Find out how to configure those on your cluster.</p>

<h2>Shared edits directory solution</h2>

<p>![Hadoop HA - NFS based edits share][http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/hadoop_ha-nfs.png]</p>

<p>For this kind of setup, there is an assumption, that in a cluster exists
a shared storage directory. It should be deployed using some kind of
network-based filesystem. You could try with NFS or GlusterFS.</p>

</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/3958555.js?file=hdfs-site.xml'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;!-- common server name --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.nameservices&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;example-cluster&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- HA configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.namenodes.example-cluster&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;nn1,nn2&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.rpc-address.example-cluster.nn1&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;master1:8020&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.rpc-address.example-cluster.nn2&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;master2:8020&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.http-address.example-cluster.nn1&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;0.0.0.0:50070&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.http-address.example-cluster.nn2&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;0.0.0.0:50070&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Storage for edits' files --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;file:///mnt/filer1/dfs/ha-name-dir-shared&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Client failover --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.client.failover.proxy.provider.example-cluster&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.ha.ConfiguredFailoverProxyProvider&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;

&lt;!-- Fencing configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.fencing.methods&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;sshfence&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
 &lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.private-key-files&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;


&lt;!-- Automatic failover configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ha.zookeeper.quorum&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>This setup is quite OK, as long as you're comfortable with maintaining a
separate service (network storage) for handling the HA state. It seems
error prone to me, because it adds another service which high
availability should be ensured. NFS seems to be a bad choice here,
because AFAIK it does not offer HA out of the box.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have GlusterFS, which is a distributed filesystem,
you can deploy on multiple bricks and increase the replication level.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it still brings additional burden of another service to
maintain.</p>

<h2>Quorum based solution</h2>

<p>![Hadoop HA - Quorum based edits share][http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/hadoop_ha-quorum.png]</p>

<p>With the release of CDH 4.1.0 we are now able to use a much better
integrated solution called JournalNode. Now all the updates are
synchronized through a JournalNode. Each JournalNode have the same data
and all the NameNodes are able to recive filesystem state updates from
that daemons.</p>

<p>This solution is much more consistent with Hadoop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Please note, that the config is almost identical to the one needed for
shared edits directory solution. The only difference is the value for
<em>dfs.namenode.shared.edits.dir</em>. This now points to all the journal
nodes deployed in our cluster.</p>

  &lt;value&gt;/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;


&lt;!-- Automatic failover configuration --&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;dfs.ha.automatic-failover.enabled&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;ha.zookeeper.quorum&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;zk1:2181,zk2:2181,zk3:2181&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;</code></pre></noscript></div>

<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<p>In both cases you need to run Zookeeper-based Failover Controller
(<em>hadoop-hdfs-zkfc</em>). This daemon negotiates which NameNode should
become active and which standby.</p>

<p>But that's not all. Depending on the way you've choosen to deploy HA you
need to do some other things:</p>

<h2>Shared edits dir</h2>

<p>With shared edits dir you need to deploy networked filesystem, and mount
it on your NameNodes. After that you can run your cluster and be happy
with your new HA.</p>

<h2>Quroum based</h2>

<p>For QJournal to operate you need to install one new package called
<em>hadoop-hdfs-journalnode</em>. This provides startup scripts for Journal
Node daemons. Choose at least three nodes that will be responsible for
handling edits state and deploy journal nodes on them.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Thanks to guys from Cloudera we now can use an enterprise grade High
Availability features for Hadoop. Eliminating the single point of
failure in your cluster is essential for easy maintainability of your
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Given the above choices, I'd suggest using QJournal setup, becasue of
its relatively small impact on the overal cluster architecture. It's
good performance and fairly simple setup enable the users to easily
start using Hadoop in HA setup.</p>

<p>Are you using Hadoop with HA? What are your impressions?</p>

<p>Hadoop's usage as a big data processing framework gains a lot of attention lately. Now, not only big players see, that they can embrace the data their sites or products are generating and develop their businesses on it. For that to happen two things are needed: the data itself and means of processing really big amounts of it.  </p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/3488314950_453466f762_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<p>Gathering data is relatively easy. These are not necessarily structured data, you don't need to plan their usage at first. Just start collecting them and than you may experiment with their potential usage. If they'll come out as useless rubbish - deleting them won't be hard <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> But imagine the values it may contribute to your business:</p>

<ul>
    <li>faster services - working on optimized data</li>
    <li>more clients - because of more relevant search results</li>
    <li>happy clients - your service can "read their minds" <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many companies that utilize Hadoop ecosystem for their own needs. You can read about some of them here: <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy</a> But since that page lacks insight into specific applications of Hadoop I've tried to delve into<br/>
details of how Hadoop helped tame some companies' big data sets.</p>

<EXCERPT>

<h2><a name="test-Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2>

<p>Being a social network provider, a widely used one, they require no introduction. However if you've lived under a rock for last couple years just visit their website <a href="http://facebook.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://facebook.com</a></p>

<p>Their main usage is data warehousing. Since they require to be able to access the data fast and reliably they had a need for real-time querying of their huge, and always growing data set. Their switch from MySQL databases was required due to the increasing workloads they experienced with standard databases. What they got "out of the box" with Hadoop was all the benefits of distributed file system (HDFS features). They expanded the ideas behind that even further and implemented truly Highly Available file system without Single Point of Failure.</p>

<p>Facebook has 3 interesting usage scenarios in which Hadoop plays a major role:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Titan - is Facebook's messaging system. It processes messages exchanged between users. Ensures that it happens fast and without glitches. Here Hadoop is used mainly as a huge, unlimited storage.</li>
    <li>Puma - Facebook Insights - a tool providing page statistics for  advanced Facebook users. Based on streams of data (clicks, likes, shares, comments and impressions) it graphs those data and makes it available near instantly.</li>
    <li>ODS - Operational Data Store - which stores Facebook's internal metrics - collections of OS and cluster health metrics. And it facilitates multiple accounting solutions.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="test-Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2>

<p>This popular micro-blogging platform, where you can register your account and follow friends and celebrities for their micro-messages does some pretty interesting things with their Hadoop cluster.</p>

<p>One of their motivations is to speed up their web-page's functionality. That is why the compute users' friendships in Twitter's social graph with Hadoop. Using connections between users they calculate their relationship to each other and estimate groups of users.</p>

<p>Since this service's users generate lots of content, the company conducts researches based on natural language processing. They probe what could be told about a user from his tweets. They use tweets' contents for advertisement purpose, trends analysis and many more.</p>

<p>From tweets and user's behaviours they characterise usage scenarios. Also, they gather usage statistics, like number of searches daily, number of tweets. Based on this seemingly irrelevant data they run comparisons of different types of users. Twitter analyzes data to determine whether mobile users, users who use third party clients or power users use Twitter differently from average users. Of course theses seem like really specific applications but nevertheless they are very original and base on the data that Twitter has been gathering for some time now. </p>

<h2><a name="test-EBay"></a>EBay</h2>

<p>Being the biggest auctioning site on the Internet, EBay uses Hadoop processing for increasing search relevance based on click-stream data, user data. This seems pretty obvious, considering their area of operation.</p>

<p>However the also have one other interesting thing - they try hard to automatically fill auctioned objects' metadata, based on the descriptions and other data provided by users. They employ data mining approach for this tasks and judging from their constant growth it seems to work <img class="emoticon" src="http://zygm0nt.github.com/confluence/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<h2><a name="test-LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2>

<p>Social network for professionals, thou a lot smaller than Facebook. Based on click-streams they discover relations between users. All the data concerning latest visits on your profile or people you may know from other places - this comes from Hadoop based analysis of those clicks people make all the time on their sites.</p>

<p>Also a very neat feature, called InMaps (<a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/</a>) analyse declared schools and companies and generates data for graph with clustered friends of yours.</p>

<h2><a name="test-Last.fm"></a>Last.fm</h2>

<p>This on-line radio site, praised by many for its invaluable recommendations' system seems like a rather small and simple service. But behind the facade of simple web page there are lots of data being processed, so that their services could match a certain level of perfection.</p>

<p>Such large volume of their data comes from scrobbles. Each users of their service listening to a song generates a note about this fact - called scrobble. Based on that and user profiles they calculate global band popularity charts, maps of bands' popularity and many more usage statistics and timeline charts.</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/7346959440_71648c9fe7_b.jpg" style="border: 0px solid black; width: 400px;" /></span></p>

<h2><a name="test-Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>They just try to detect and trace new patterns in seemingly chaotic data sets. Perhaps you could also do the same? Analyze your data and expand your business value?</p></div>

<p>Suppose you want to add some additional jars to your SoapUI installation. It all should work ok if you put them in <b>bin/ext</b> directory. It is scanned at startup, and jars found there are automatically added to classpath.
</p>

<p>
However if you want to add some JDBC drivers, and happen to be using SoapUI version higher than 3.5.1 it is a bit more tricky.
</p>
<p>You may face this NoClassDefFoundError:<br/>

<pre>
An error occured [oracle/jdbc/Driver], see error log for details
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: oracle/jdbc/Driver
</pre>
</p> 

<p>
If so, try registering your drivers with <b>registerJdbcDriver</b> function, like I did in this snippet of code:
</p>
<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1333768.js?file=jdbc-soapui.groovy'></script>

<b>... or how I ended up writing a CouchDB proof of concept app?</b>

<p>Once upon a time I set out on a journey to discover the NoSQL land.
I've decided that doing simple queries wouldn't be interesting enough.
That's why I've chose to create an app that would be based on some NoSQL
database.</p>

<p>
The main idea was to create an app, that would dynamically update itself
with geographic data flowing in. Since there are myriads of geo-data
that are available on the internet, you can pick your favorite one and
load them into your SQL database of choice.
</p>

<EXCERPT>
<p>
In my case the primary source of data was a proprietary database, or more specifically - one table in it continuously updated with new data. To make that
data visible on my map I needed to:
</p>

<ul>
<li> buffer the huge amount of those records - so as not to overhoul
other services with large traffic, and not to flood the frontend</li>
<li> convert then to my representation</li>
<li> display them - have presentation layer in a browser - since
browser-based frontend was the easiest and fastest to develop</li>
</ul>

<p>
The idea of the front-end HTML page was to show new points on the map.
From the moment of opening the page records that appear in database
table should be shown interactively on the screen.
</p>

<h2>Toys used</h2>

<p>
For the first step I chose to use RabbitMQ broker. A queue on the broker would receive messages - one message per database table's row.
Then I'd use some simple groovy middle ware to convert the data to appropriate format and put it onto another db - this time db specific
to my app. 
</p>

<p>
You may ask why incorporate another database. It would be
good for separating environments - assuming the original data contains
some vulnerable content that should be anatomised, or we just don't feel
comfortable exposing the whole database of some XYZ-system just to have
access to its one table.
</p>

<p>
Since for my presentation layer I chose HTML+JS without any application server-based back-end I've decided on CouchDB . This seemed like
a perfect match for this scenario. Why? - ease of use, REST API, with JSON responses - just great for interacting with my simple front-end.
</p>

<p>
The flow of things was as shown on the image below:
</p>

<IMG src="http://blog.innovative-labs.com/blog/gmapper.png"
alt="diagram"/>

<h2>Avro - for the beginning</h2>
<p>
As you can see, I've chosen JSON as my data-format. I've been considering
<a href="http://avro.apache.org">Apache Avro</a> in the first place but
using it was a real pain in the ass. Avro itself is used in <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Apache Hadoop</a> as a serialization
layer, so it would seem OK, but it has virtually <em>no
documentation</em>. But once you tear through the unintuitive interface
and manage to handle all those unthinkable exceptions you get a few pros
for this library. It's great in that it does not require code generation - I
like it being made on the fly. It also offers sending data in binary
format, which was not necessary, but never the less is a nice feature.
</p>

<p>
What I certainly didn't like about it was its orientation on the files
rather than chunks of data - so it was not so obvious how should I send
data through the wire. 
</p>

<p>
Than I found out it can produce JSON output, which would work for me,
except the output could not have been parsed by other JSON libraries :)
(<a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5375243/jcouchdb-svenson-unable-to-parse-json-string">I've
asked on stackoverflow about that, but with no luck</a>). 
</p>

<p>If my whining haven't put you back and still would like to see how to use Avro, try this unit
test in project's GitHub repo: <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blob/master/feeder/src/test/groovy/pl/ftang/example/feeder/avro/AvroSimpleTest.groovy">AvroSimpleTest.groovy</a>
</p>


<h2>Svenson</h2>

<p>
I've dropped Avro in favour of a simple JSON lib called (<a
href="http://code.google.com/p/svenson/">Svenson</a> and that was
painless. The only thing I was forced to do was create my model class in
Java - the rest of the project is written in Groovy. I've no idea why
was that necessary, and didn't want to look into it.
</p>

<h2>RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>
Further on the way is <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, to which records are filled by a feeding
middle-ware written in Groovy. Since I use <a
href="http://activemq.apache.org">ActiveMQ</a> on a day-to-day basis,
I've decided to try something new. This broker is a really nice piece of
software. Being written in Erlang makes it really fast. What's more it
has some extensive capabilities and is easy to approach for anyone
similar with messaging (JMS and friends). For such a lightweight product
it is really powerful - implements AMQP! 
</p>

<h2>CouchDB</h2>

<p>
From the broker's queue messages are again fetched by a middle-ware just
to be put into <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> view.
This database is also written in Erlang. It's very reliable, however the
way it handles refreshing view isn't the most pleasant one -
performance-wise. 
</p>

<p>
Word of advice - if you're on Debian derivative, be cautious with
apt-repository version. It's rather _ancient_. Also remember to add
<b>allow_jsonp = true</b> to you config file
<i>/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/local.ini</i>. It's not enabled by
default, and not having this set would result with empty responses from
the CouchDB server.</p>

<p>The problem here is, that the browser doesn't allow quering a web server with hostname other than the one the script originates.
 More on this case <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3386679/connection-ajax-couchdb-and-javascript">here</a>. Seems like my problem could be overcame by changing url in index.html and hostname couchdb listens on to the same address.
</p>

<p>
I've also created a view, that would expose an event by key: <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blame/master/couchdb/by_date_view.js">view
code</a>
</p>

<h2>Presenting the dots</h2>

<p>
As a back-end I've done some JQuery based AJAX calls - nothing too
fancy. All things necessary for presentation layer are in <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped/blob/master/index.html">this
file</a>.
</p>

<h2>Things to consider</h2>

<p>
Please bear in mind that this whole application is rather a playground,
not a full-fledged project!! After creating all the parts I have some
doubts about some architectural decisions I made. I don't think the
security have been taken into account seriously enough. Also scalability
was never an issue ;-)
</p>

<p>
If you have some thoughts about any of the aspects mentioned in this
post, please feel free to comment or contact me directly :)
</p>

<p>

And also you may try the application by yourself - it's on the <a
href="https://github.com/zygm0nt/gmapped">GitHub</a>.

<p>&gt;The main idea was to create an app, that would dynamically update itself with geographic data flowing in. <br />
<br />
Not to nitpick, but that doesn't seem like an idea for app. I think you should explain what that displayed data is here.  If you moved your 'Presenting the dots' paragraph just above 'Toys used', it would be clear what do you wanted to do with this app.<br />
<br />
&gt;Also remember to add allow_jsonp = true to you config file /opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/local.ini.<br />
<br />
I think you should explain what that option *really* does.<br />
<br />
Other than that, nice post!</p></div>

    <id>http://zygm0nt.github.com/blog/2011/07/14/oval-validate-your-models-quickly-and-effortlessly</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Some time ago one of the projects at work required me to validate
some Java POJOs. Theses were my model classes and I've been creating
them from incoming WebService requests. One would say that XSD would be
sufficient for the task, for parts of this validations - sure, it would.
But there were some advanced rules XSD would not handle, or would render
the schema document very complicated.</p>

<p>Rules I needed to express were like:

<ul>

<li>person's <i>first_name</i> and <i>last_name</i> should be of appropriate length -
between 2 and 20, and additionally one could pass a zero-length string
just to remove the previous value</li>
<li><i>state</i> field should consist only defined values - as in
dictionary value - this one would be completable with XSD's
enumerations, but would require often changing schema files and
redistributing them to interested parties :(</li>
</ul>

<p>The library I've decided to use for this task is <a
href="http://oval.sf.net">OVal</a> and it came out really nice! Read on
to find out the details!</p>

<EXCERPT>

<p>Oval is quite mature library that allows POJO validation, but is not
JSR303 (bean validation) implementation. It has converters that enable
it to understand those annotations, but I'm not sure about the
compatibility.</p>

<p>I've tried only a subset of the available checks, among which
were:</p>

<ul>
<li>NotNull</li>
<li>NotEmpty</li>
<li>Length</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more, and their attributes give interesting ways to
configure the validation process. But using them was rather easy and did
not require to much brainstorming. What I really needed were custom
checks. And in this area OVal shows it's strength. Implementing a check
is really easy.</p>

<p>I needed an annotation that would check a field against some values in
a dictionary. If field's value was in the given set, than the validation
would succeed, if not, an exception would be thrown. To accomplish this
task it is required to implement two classes: annotation class and check
class - called by the validation engine on a given field.</p>

<p>Let's start with our new annotation:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=DictionaryValue.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>import net.sf.oval.configuration.annotation.Constraint;

import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.METHOD})
@Constraint(checkWith = DictionaryValueCheck.class)
public @interface DictionaryValue {
    /**
     * message to be used for the ConstraintsViolatedException
     *
     * @see ConstraintsViolatedException
     */
    String message() default &quot;constraint.DictionaryValue.violated&quot;;

    String file();
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

In the above snippet I've defined a check-annotation, that would be used like
this:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=sample.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>public class Address {
        ....
	@DictionaryValue(file = &quot;/validation/voivodeship.txt&quot;) String state;
        ....
}</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

You can pass <i>file</i> - containing dictionary values for this field.
There is also <i>message</i> field in the annotation which is an error
message returned by the validation engine of failed check - pretty
handy. And can be expressed in <i>.properties</i> file as:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=validation.properties'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>constraint.DictionaryValue.violated={context} is not among allowed dictionary values</code></pre></noscript></div>
 

<p>Placeholder, like <i>context</i>, will be replaced with correct values supplied by the
validation engine.</p>

Annotating a field is not enough. It is also needed to create a validator
for this kind of check. The name of the class is already defined in
<i>DictionaryValue</i> annotation, it is called
<i>DictionaryValueCheck</i> and I've done this check this way:

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1077516.js?file=DictionaryValueCheck.java'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>import net.sf.oval.Validator;
import net.sf.oval.configuration.annotation.AbstractAnnotationCheck;
import net.sf.oval.context.OValContext;
import net.sf.oval.exception.OValException;
import org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils;
import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class DictionaryValueCheck extends AbstractAnnotationCheck&lt;DictionaryValue&gt; {

    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(DictionaryValueCheck.class);

    private String file;

    Map&lt;String, String&gt; dictionary;

    @Override
	public void configure(final DictionaryValue constraintAnnotation) {
		super.configure(constraintAnnotation);
		setFile(constraintAnnotation.file());
	}

    private void setFile(String file) {
        this.file = file;
        dictionary = loadDictionaryFrom(file);
        requireMessageVariablesRecreation();
    }

    private Map&lt;String, String&gt; loadDictionaryFrom(String file) {
        String fileStr;
        Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
        try {
            fileStr = IOUtils.toString(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream(file));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            log.error(&quot;Error loading file: &quot;, e);
            return map;
        }
        for (String line : fileStr.split(&quot;\n&quot;)) {
            if (line.trim().length() == 0)
                continue;
            String[] tokens = line.split(&quot; &quot;, 2); // we want 2 substrings max
            if (tokens.length == 2)
                map.put(tokens[0], tokens[1]);
            if (tokens.length == 1)
                map.put(tokens[0], null);
        }
        return map;
    }

    public boolean isSatisfied(Object validatedObject, Object valueToValidate, OValContext context, Validator validator) throws OValException {
        if (valueToValidate == null)
            return true;
        return dictionary.containsKey(valueToValidate);
    }
}
</code></pre></noscript></div>


What this basically does is:
<ol>
<li>when <i>file</i> is set - read dictionary content from the file into
map</li>
<li>upon check request just lookup value in dictionary parsed from the
input file</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it!</p>

<p>For me Oval is really great tool. With it at ones disposal it is extremely easy to create any
imaginable validation you need. This library is really easy to use and
offers lots of handy features.</p>

<p>But perhaps I'm reinventing the wheel and all this can be done easily
with some other library? Share Your opinion!</p>

<p>Now that's a great question. I've forgotten to write about this, but OVal offers profiles, which you can disable or enable whenever you like. You set a profile for a specific annotation. In your case let's assume You have two operations: add and update. Your model has field annotated with @NotNull(profile=&quot;UPDATE&quot;), which means we don't want null values on it when updating. In _add_ operation you disable the profile called UPDATE, so the annotation is also disabled. When calling _update_ you enable the profile and the validation is performed. <br />

<p>Question:<br />
Say, we have an object with a primary key, that is mandatory (in the database), but described as AUTOINCREMENT. When client sends new object data, the primary key is obviously null, but we need to validate it for not-nullity in other cases.<br />
<br />
Doea OVal handle variations / directions of validation?</p></div>
