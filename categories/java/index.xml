      <description>An application developed for one of my recent projects at TouK involved multiple servers. There was a requirement to ensure failover for the system&amp;rsquo;s components. Since I had already a few separate components I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to add more of that, and since there already was a Zookeeper ensemble running - required by one of the services, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go that way with my solution. What is Zookeeper?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s 2.x version, there finally is a working
High-Availability solution. Even two of those. Now it really is easy to
configure and use those solutions. It no longer require external
components, like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2009/07/hadoop-ha-configuration/&#34;&gt;DRBD&lt;/a&gt;.
It all is just neatly packed into Cloudera Hadoop distribution - the
precursor of this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
