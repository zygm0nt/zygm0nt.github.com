      <description>Some time ago, I read a good writeup about the SolarWinds incident that happened in 2020. You can get to that article by clicking this link. This article is well-written and portrays multiple persons involved in solving the case. Really enjoyable piece.
This blog post sums up the incident from the technical perspective and also goes deeper into multiple aspects of it, using data taken from different sources.
Note: Another, more recent supply-chain attack is the xz backdoor.</description>

      <description>Recently I came across two very interesting options in git that I wanted to make a note of.
One is a general feature - conditional configs - that you can probably utilise in a myriad of ways. The second - commit signing - might seem a bit obscure.
Conditional configs It appears it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to put conditional properties into your .gitconfig file. This way, you can have a separate entities depending on which repositories you commit to.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;source: Dall-E, prompt: generate an image for blogpost titled &amp;ldquo;breaking a paywall&amp;rdquo;, about exploiting newssite paywall using browser extension&amp;rdquo;
Today&amp;rsquo;s internet is progressively becoming more and more hostile. It is actually a bunch of walled gardens, in the form of Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, all the other social media outlets. Now, also news sites are increasingly becoming a payed instances.
I totally get it, authoring all that content is not cheap.</description>
