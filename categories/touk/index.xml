      <title>Super Confitura Man</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-super-confitura-man-came-to-be-&#34;&gt;How Super Confitura Man came to be :)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently at TouK we had a one-day hackathon. There was no main theme for
it, you just could post a project idea, gather people around it and hack
on that idea for a whole day - drinks and pizza included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main idea was to create something that could be fun to build and be
useful somehow to others. I’d figured out that since Confitura was just
around a corner I could make a game, that would be playable at TouK’s
booth at the conference venue. This idea seemed good enough to attract
Rafał Nowak &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RNowak3&#34;&gt;@RNowak3&lt;/a&gt; and Marcin Jasion
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/marcinjasion&#34;&gt;@marcinjasion&lt;/a&gt; - two TouK employees, that with me
formed a team for the hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distributed scans with HBase</title>
      <link>http://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2013/12/10/distributed-scans-with-hbase/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HBase is by design a columnar store, that is optimized for random reads.
You just ask for a row using rowId as an identifier and you get your
data instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing a scan on part or whole table is a completely different thing.
First of all, it is sequential. Meaning it is rather slow, because it
doesn&amp;rsquo;t use all the RegionServers at the same time. It is implemented
that way to realize the contract of Scan command - which has to return
results sorted by key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how to do this efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple HBase ORM</title>
      <link>http://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2013/12/08/simple-hbase-orm/</link>

      <guid>http://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2013/12/08/simple-hbase-orm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When dealing with data stored in HBase, you are quick to come to a
conclusion, that it is extremaly inconvenient to reach to it
via HBase native API. It is very verbose and you always need to convert
between bytes and simple types - a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was working on a project of mine, I thought, why not to easy
those pains and fetch real objects from HBase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how this simplistic, hackish ORM came to life. It is no match
for projects like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/impetus-opensource/Kundera&#34;&gt;Kundera&lt;/a&gt;
(a JPA compliant solution), or &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/n-orm/&#34;&gt;n-orm&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, it just suits my needs :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading through storm-users Google Group recently. This
resolution was heavily inspired by Adam Kawa&amp;rsquo;s post &lt;a href=&#34;http://hakunamapdata.com/football-zero-apache-pig-hero-the-essence-from-hundreds-of-posts-from-apache-pig-user-mailing-list/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Football zero, Apache Pig hero&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a lot of insightful and very interesting information I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to describe some of those in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>An application developed for one of my recent projects at TouK involved multiple servers. There was a requirement to ensure failover for the system&amp;rsquo;s components. Since I had already a few separate components I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to add more of that, and since there already was a Zookeeper ensemble running - required by one of the services, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go that way with my solution. What is Zookeeper?</description>

      <description>W najbliższy czwartek - czyli 29.11.2012 - poprowadzę prezentację w ramach Warsaw Hadoop User Group. Swoją obecność można odklinąć tu http://www.meetup.com/warsaw-hug/
A o czym będę mówił? Przeklejka ze strony WHUG:
 Marcin skupi się na współpracy ekosystemu Hadoopa z innymi narzędziami. Pokaże jak prosto i wygodnie przetwarzać grafy i jak stosować podejście Big Data, w czasie rzeczywistym. Poruszy również temat łatwiejszego tworzenia algorytmów Map-Reduce
Będzie to nieco mniej technicza (ale wciąż praktyczna) wycieczka po obrzeżach tematyki, która jest zwykle poruszana w połączeniu z Hadoop-em.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s 2.x version, there finally is a working
High-Availability solution. Even two of those. Now it really is easy to
configure and use those solutions. It no longer require external
components, like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2009/07/hadoop-ha-configuration/&#34;&gt;DRBD&lt;/a&gt;.
It all is just neatly packed into Cloudera Hadoop distribution - the
precursor of this solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hadoop&#39;s usage as a big data processing framework gains a lot of attention lately. Now, not only big players see, that they can embrace the data their sites or products are generating and develop their businesses on it. For that to happen two things are needed: the data itself and means of processing really big amounts of it. 
Gathering data is relatively easy. These are not necessarily structured data, you don&#39;t need to plan their usage at first.</description>

      <description>Suppose you want to add some additional jars to your SoapUI installation. It all should work ok if you put them in bin/ext directory. It is scanned at startup, and jars found there are automatically added to classpath.  However if you want to add some JDBC drivers, and happen to be using SoapUI version higher than 3.5.1 it is a bit more tricky. You may face this NoClassDefFoundError:  An error occured [oracle/jdbc/Driver], see error log for details java.</description>

      <description>... or how I ended up writing a CouchDB proof of concept app? Once upon a time I set out on a journey to discover the NoSQL land. I&#39;ve decided that doing simple queries wouldn&#39;t be interesting enough. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve chose to create an app that would be based on some NoSQL database.
 The main idea was to create an app, that would dynamically update itself with geographic data flowing in.</description>

      <description>Some time ago one of the projects at work required me to validate some Java POJOs. Theses were my model classes and I&#39;ve been creating them from incoming WebService requests. One would say that XSD would be sufficient for the task, for parts of this validations - sure, it would. But there were some advanced rules XSD would not handle, or would render the schema document very complicated.
Rules I needed to express were like:  person&#39;s first_name and last_name should be of appropriate length - between 2 and 20, and additionally one could pass a zero-length string just to remove the previous value state field should consist only defined values - as in dictionary value - this one would be completable with XSD&#39;s enumerations, but would require often changing schema files and redistributing them to interested parties :(  The library I&#39;ve decided to use for this task is OVal and it came out really nice!</description>

      <description>And now for part 2 of my visit to Geecon 2011!
 1. Jim Webber &#34;Revisiting SOA for the 21st century&#34; Now this was awesome! Jim Webber, a former ThoughtWorks employee, now Neo4j evangelist (in Neotechnology) described his views on how SOA should look - according to him. This was presented previously, on other occasions as his &#34;Guerilla SOA&#34; talk - generally he advocated for REST based services, loose contracts (stating that WSDLs are too verbose and code generation is evil).</description>

      <description>Last week&#39;s Java conference - Geecon was very interesting. It was well prepared, and gave an insight into the current Java related trends - concurrency, DSLs, polyglot programming. But not only that - there were also some pretty different talks from excellent speakers.
 The whole event took 4 days:  University day (wednesday) 2 regular conference days (Thursday + Friday)  hacker garden (Sunday)   I decided to attend only on Thursday and Friday - no time for more.</description>

      <description>Recently at work I was in need of connecting to a web service exposed via HTTPS. I&#39;ve been doing this from inside Servicemix 3.3.1, which may seem a bit inhibiting, but that was a requirement. Nevertheless I&#39;ve been trying my luck with the included servicemix-http-2008.01 component. I&#39;ve created a simple Service Unit using that component and made connection attempt. Unfortunately I&#39;ve encountered issues with the SSL conversation negotiation. I had to dig deeper into the servicemix-http code to find out these had something to do with my JCE keystore.</description>

      <description>The most crucial part of software development is testing. It should ensure us, that our code is correct, works according to given specs, etc. There are many kinds of tests: unit tests, integration, functional. In general you should try to test the smallest possible subset of your code and be able to check the state of the objects after the test.  This seems as rather easy task, but what if you have an integration end-to-end test to perform?</description>

      <description>This weekend I&#39;ve been fiddling with QEMU. I&#39;ve installed OpenBSD on a single image and wanted to have two instances of it communicating via network. Installing the system was easy, but the networking setup was quite a pain. See how I did that...  To make QEMU instances communicate with each other I needed to plug them to a &#34;network&#34;. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve created a bridge to which Virtual Instances would connect to.</description>

      <title>JMS redelivery with ActiveMQ and Servicemix</title>

      <description>The other day I felt a compelling need to implement a JMS redelivery scenario. The exact scenario I&#39;d been trying to handle was:  my message is in an ActiveMQ queue or topic its processing fails, because of some exception - ie. database access exception due to server nonavailability since we get an exception, the message is not handled properly, we may want to retry processing attempt some time later of course, for the redelivery to happen we need the message to stay in the ActiveMQ queue - fetching messages from the queue will be stopped until the redelivery succeeds or expires  See how this can be done after the jump :)   For this to happen, I&#39;ve tried implementing Apache Camel route, but as it turns out, Camel fails to deliver facilities for exact JMS redelivery.</description>

      <description>JMS seems like a hostile ground. It has all it&#39;s quirks and strange behaviours. A couple of defining standards plus esoteric brokers, queues and topics.    At work, we mainly use open source Jms solutions, namely Apache ActiveMQ. This one is usually bundled with Apache Servicemix, as a message broker for this particular ESB. As there are some minor caveats in this scennerio, I&#39;d like to describe here some guidelines for getting to running JMS queues.</description>

      <description>In an ideal world all the standards fit well into their places. It is sufficient to use just one serious standard, because all the problems can be solved with it - the standardization processes is there for some reason. But that happens only in ideal world, which we&#39;re not living in.   In ideal world, when dealing with XML instances you&#39;d be more than fulfilled using XML Schema, or RelaxNG, or any other simple xml formal definition language to declare your data structure.</description>

What&#39;s more, this tools corresponds well with our approach to integration solutions:   try to operate on XML messages, so you get the advantage of XPaths, XSL and other benefits,  don&#39;t convert XML into Java classes back and forth and be worried with problems like XML conversion,  try to get a simple flow of the process.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I&#39;ve attended MeetBSD conference in Kraków. This BSD event is held yearly in either Warsaw, or Kraków. Due to relatively small group of people that registered there was only one track, which had both good and bad sides - you didn&#39;t have to choose from myriads of lectures, but there was no way to skip boring ones either. Well, I guess this kind of niche conference - about operating system :) - will not attract bigger attention.</description>

      <description>My goal was to create a simple, extensible Enum converter that would work with iBatis. This seems like a trivial problem, but took me a while to find a proper solution.
 There were some additional preconditions:  all given Enums are jaxb generated objects - but any standard Java Enum should work conversion was 1-to-1, no special conditions and processing  The example Enum for this problem looks like this one (copy&amp;amp;paste from jaxb generated source):</description>

      <description>This year&#39;s Javarsovia conference took place on 26th june. It was held at Centrum Konferencyjno-Kongresowe, Bobrowiecka Street, Warsaw.
First of all - the organization was very nice. Everything seemed smooth, maybe with the exception of conference registration, it was simply overcrowded. The agenda was split into four tracks, each hour 4 different presentations were given in different halls. So you just had to choose which one to attend. My path through the conference is described below, together with my views on each of the presentations I attended.</description>

      <description>Do you use Eclipse? Or perhaps you use other IDE but would like to try &#34;the big E&#34;? Well, that&#39;s OK, and completely understandable, because Eclipse is actually a great, versatile tool. But Eclipse is not just an IDE, in fact it is a comp let, extensible platform. What&#39;s even more important, there are tones of valuable Eclipse-related projects gathered around the platform.
Yes, there are lots. Some are good, some are bad, but the usual, stock ones, signed by Eclipse, are worth taking a closer look.</description>
