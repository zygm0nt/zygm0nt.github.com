      <description>I really like watching some culinary channels on Youtube. Those can be roughly divided into two categories:
people cooking some specific recipe people doing a review of a restaurant or a bunch of them It&amp;rsquo;s nice to watch, but after that not too much I can keep from that. If I like a specific recipe, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to cook that think it&amp;rsquo;s really counter productive to try cooking from the video.</description>

      <title>Extracting articles from Pocket - or ChatGPT for the needed but not interesting stuff</title>

      <description>Pocket is a nice service. It can save articles from the web for you to read later. Nice. It can even help in bypassing annoying paywalls (more on this here). With the ease of using it, I can quickly end up with a substantial backlog of articles to go through. Since reading long articles on a screen feels like a chore, I came up with the idea of exporting articles into EPub format and reading them on an e-reader.</description>

      <title>Tracers in the dark</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This blogpost is not about a specific book, titled Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency. It&amp;rsquo;s just about execution traces.
I wanted to explore a few techniques for visualising inter-dependencies between fragments of code, modules, etc. Say, you have multiple functions and you want to get some bearing on how much each execution of each of those functions takes. Or you have a complicated system, and you&amp;rsquo;d like to plot remote calls in this system.</description>

      <title>Get to your AWS host with ease</title>

      <description>If you deploy to cloud, ideally you should be able to analyze and debug your system using observability tools. There should be no need to log in to your hosts directly. But life is life, and there might be issues with this or that, and to debug them, direct access to a host is just much easier.
Instead of doing a long sequence of clicks through your WebUI in AWS console, you can also access your host with a script.</description>

      <title>Why Google Takeout is sooo bad!</title>
      <link>https://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2024/06/16/why-google-takeout-is-sooo-bad/</link>

      <description>Author: IdeogramAI Prompt: The image shows a typical Google Takeout interface with a large error message indicating that the service is unavailable. In the background, there are frustrated users trying to download their data with unsuccessful attempts, represented by repeated &amp;ldquo;Failed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Retry&amp;rdquo; notifications.
My current data setup is centered around Google Cloud as a place where I store my data. That&amp;rsquo;s also related to how I use the whole vendor ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Updating Confluence page from Markdown</title>

      <description>Prompt: generate an image for blogpost titled &amp;ldquo;Moving markdown files to confluence&amp;rdquo;
Assume you want to have your documentation close to the code. Ideally in your project&amp;rsquo;s repo. But then there&amp;rsquo;s always this request, that other people might want to look through that documentation, they&amp;rsquo;re not too tech savy, no nothing about Git.
A few past companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for have had their internal wikis built on Atlassian Confluence. It seems there&amp;rsquo;s quite nice way to upload pages stored in repository to arbitrary location in Confluence.</description>

      <title>SolarWinds supply chain attack</title>
      <link>https://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2024/04/07/solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/</link>

      <description>Some time ago, I read a good writeup about the SolarWinds incident that happened in 2020. You can get to that article by clicking this link. This article is well-written and portrays multiple persons involved in solving the case. Really enjoyable piece.
This blog post sums up the incident from the technical perspective and also goes deeper into multiple aspects of it, using data taken from different sources.
Note: Another, more recent supply-chain attack is the xz backdoor.</description>

      <title>Git - conditional configs and commit signing</title>
      <link>https://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2024/03/28/git-conditional/</link>

      <guid>https://marcin.cylke.com.pl/2024/03/28/git-conditional/</guid>
      <description>Recently I came across two very interesting options in git that I wanted to make a note of.
One is a general feature - conditional configs - that you can probably utilise in a myriad of ways. The second - commit signing - might seem a bit obscure.
Conditional configs It appears it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to put conditional properties into your .gitconfig file. This way, you can have a separate entities depending on which repositories you commit to.</description>

      <title>Payload after load, really?!</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;source: Dall-E, prompt: generate an image for blogpost titled &amp;ldquo;breaking a paywall&amp;rdquo;, about exploiting newssite paywall using browser extension&amp;rdquo;
Today&amp;rsquo;s internet is progressively becoming more and more hostile. It is actually a bunch of walled gardens, in the form of Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, all the other social media outlets. Now, also news sites are increasingly becoming a payed instances.
I totally get it, authoring all that content is not cheap.</description>
