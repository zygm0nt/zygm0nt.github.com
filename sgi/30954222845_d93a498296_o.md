Augmented Reality on old SGI
Just playing with an old deom of the ARToolKit (
www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/ ) on my SGI O2.

 

 It's the simple exemple (only the Cube was replaced by the famous GLUT
 Teapot).

  

  The upper camera view is a real one - the lower includes the virtual
  teapot (fortunately it was empty - so no liquid is on my desk). ;-)

   

   Well, I have to rotate the teapot....
