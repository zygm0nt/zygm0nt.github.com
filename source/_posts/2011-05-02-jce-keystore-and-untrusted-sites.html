<div class='post'>
<p>Recently at work I was in need of connecting to a web service exposed via
HTTPS. I've been doing this from inside <a href="http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html">Servicemix 3.3.1</a>, which may seem
a bit inhibiting, but that was a requirement. Nevertheless I've been
trying my luck with the included <em>servicemix-http-2008.01</em>
component. I've created a simple <a
href="http://servicemix.apache.org/working-with-service-units.html">Service
Unit</a> using that component and made connection attempt.
Unfortunately I've encountered issues with the SSL conversation
negotiation. I had to dig deeper into the <em>servicemix-http</em> code
to find out these had something to do with my <a
href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Java_Cryptography_Extension">JCE</a>
keystore. Read more to find out what happened!</p>
<EXCERPT>
<p>Ok, so I had my <em>xbean.xml</em> for http component looking like
this:</p>

{% gist 951474 servicemix-http-xbean.xml %}


<p>As you can see this is a proxy adapter to some outside service
exposed via secured HTTP protocol. Since it's <em>HTTPS</em> I've
specified some SSL parameters. It was sufficient in my case to just pass
the keystore file and it's password.</p>

<p>I've created my <em>keystore.jks</em> file in <em>smx_home/conf</em>
with password <em>servicemix</em> in the following manner:</p>

{% gist 951459 create_keystore.sh %}

<p>You can see what's in this file with this command:</p>

{% gist 951459 list_keys.sh %}

<p>At this point I thought, that having a configured keystore and my
component would suffice. Wrong! As soon as I've tried to connect to the
external service I got an exception:</p>

{% gist 951458 untrusted_key_error.java %}

<p>Hmmm.. this looks pretty nasty, but it's not that bad. As one can
read <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/gc/entry/unable_to_find_valid_certification">here</a>,
it's associated with the other site's having an untrusted (unsigned)
certificate. Assuming you actually trust the other end of the
communication and this situation is ok for you, you should add the
servers certificate to your keystore. The previously mentioned link
contained a little java class that would do just that. You can find it
here (original code) <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/andreas/resource/InstallCert.java">InstallCert.java</a>
or you can look into my slightly changed version here <a
href="https://gist.github.com/951492">at github</a>.</p>

<p>You should call it as follows, assuming that file
<em>keystore.jks</em> is in the current directory:</p>

<script
src="https://gist.github.com/951459.js?file=add_untrusted_key.sh"></script>

<p>What you'll probably see, when you execute this app is this:</p>

{% gist 951458 add_untrusted_cert.sh %}

<p>Please note that there is a prompt (<em>Enter certificate to add to
trusted keystore...</em>) in which you can enter the certificate number
you wish to add to your keystore.</p>

<p>After all those steps my request got through and I could happily
query HTTPS service as long as I wanted to! Great!</p>

<h2>Possible problems</h2>

<p>In my search for this problem's solution I've encountered this kind
of exception:</p>

{% gist 951458 keystore_key_error.java %}

<p>A little googling led me to this <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4926290/java-keystore-and-password-settings">question</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that you cannot have multiple keys with different passwords
in the same keystore and use <a
href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/KeyManagerFactory.html">KeyManagerFactory</a> class. Oh
well...</p>.

<h2>Ending</h2>

<p>To sum up, the solution given works, but in my opinion using the
<em>InstallCert.java</em> app is rather dirty. I've been wondering, do
you know other ways of doing that thing?</p>
