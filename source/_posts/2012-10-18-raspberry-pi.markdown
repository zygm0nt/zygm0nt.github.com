About a month ago I finally received my very own Raspberry Pi board!
Don't know what that is? Here, read some at their
[website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

For the sake of completness let me just describe that as prototyping
platform with ARM processor. It is really similar in concept to what
Arduino is, except it has not that many extensions available (none? or
very little, I've only found those on [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/)
pages).

So, here is the obligatory picture.

It can run a Linux distribution, so anyone familiar with that can have a
go with this low-powered computer. 

The board itself is on the market for quite some time now. That's why
there are lots of interesting resources and projects that you can do
with that stuff.

Here are just a bunch of them:

* [UberFridge](http://www.elcojacobs.com/uberfridge/) - for all the
  brewers in the world :)
* SOHO server 
* a supercomputer - [cluster out of R-Pi](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/features/raspberry_pi_supercomputer.shtml)
* Arcade Cabinet - [custom build gaming rig](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1814)

* sending R-Pi to [the edge of Space](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2059)
