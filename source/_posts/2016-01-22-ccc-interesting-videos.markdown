It's been some time since the most recent incarnation on Chaos Congress
took place ([CCC site](http://www.ccc.de/)). I've finally managed to
sift through some of the videos. Have a selection of those I've found
most interesting to me. If there are others really worth watching - pass
me a line! Cheers.

{% youtube FO68gG320SM %}

* INSIDE GLORIOUS LEADER’S OPERATING SYSTEM - this one is actually
  great! No ridiculing, just a review of features. Go see what os-level
  surveilance looks like:

* 3D printing on the moon - just printing something on your 3d printer
  seems trivial compared to the challange of doing this under Moon
  conditions:
